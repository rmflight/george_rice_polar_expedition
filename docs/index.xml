<p>I hauled my quota of ice. The quarters have become a perfect Babel or worse. The tinner, carpenter, tentmaker and shoemaker are all busily engaged at their several callings preparing the foot gear, sledges, lamps and other paraphernalia for the eagerly-looked-forward to spring explorations.</p>

<p>Linn, Connell and Biederbeck went to the coal mines to mine some coals. I went along with gun hoping to get a shot at my hare. The caracaturist of our party has embellished the wall with a drawing representing my surprise at seeing the “kangaroo.”</p>
<p>I was gone five hours and saw nothing in the way of game. I succeeded however, in freezing my cheeks and nose. The weather is slightly warmer.</p>

<p>Hauled ice. Took a walk with Dr — see P J</p>
<p>Several parties were out hunting as the light has now become so bright as to make it safe and pleasant. The quarters still present the appearance of a machine shop. A boat which Cross is painting bas been added to the stock. The temperature has taken a remarkable rise.</p>

<p>A quiet Sabbath. The light has increased so that today the idea of beholding ourselves by natural instead of artificial light occurred to some of us. We were all perplexed at the bleached out appearance of our countenances.</p>
<p>I was much amused at the consternation of the old “Kingatoon” — our boss dog — when I showed him his “counterfeit presentment” in a mirror: he showed fight at once. I took a walk with Schneider and the pups.</p>
<p>Jewell with driver and dog team made a trip to Murchison and back taking some stores.</p>
<p>A very quiet evening after the rum passed around.</p>
<p>I indulge in some reflections of a sentimental, slushy nature — see private journal.</p>

<p>Henry’s birthday; a good bill of fare. Lt. Greely tells me to prepare for taking observations.</p>
<p>Ralston and Schneider go to Bellot Island to read the meteorological instruments.</p>
<p>They see a hare. I go on duty at midnight.</p>

<p>The sky this morning was of a most beautiful rose color, predicting the appearance of the sun which showed its upper limit at 11.40 a.m. The whole disk was seen from 11:45 to 11:57</p>
<p>Gardiner, Connell and I — just coming off observations miss seeing the returning luminary. The prodigal sun was just seen by Dr.&nbsp;Pavy. Ralston and Henry who met him at the top of Cairn Hill before he lighted up our somber dwelling. I believe it is the rule to indulge in some attempt at poetical allusion to the eagerly wished for return of Old Sol: but for the most rosily beautiful description of the event to be found in arctic literature commend me to Hayes’ gem of a paragraph which discourages any attempt at imitation as completely as the effluguent rays of the glorious sun pales the feeble light of the silvery moon.” It made the moon sick” was the rather inelegant comment of Whistler.</p>
<p>Whistler by the way went gunning today and joining a snow slide goes whirling down one of the precipitous bluffs of Bellot Island. He suffers no greater injury than the wearing out of his pants. The United States Govt. however, sustains the loss of a rifle which was broken in the catastrophe.</p>
<p>Bender is quite unwell. He is troubled with his lungs and I fear will hardly endure two winters here. Temp -47.6 Mean: -39.69</p>
<p>A small party are making preparations to cross over to Hall’s rest.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wednesday-march-1st-1882">Wednesday March 1st 1882</h2>
<p>Lt. Lockwood, Jewell and Brainard with Frederick and the dog team start for the Greenland coast by way of Beechy. Long goes to support them so far as Beechy with Jens and the other team. Their object is to examine the condition of the provisions left by Polaris and English party on the other side to decide to what extent they can be depended upon for the sledge journey in the spring.</p>
<p>The quarters are still lumbered up with lumber, sledges, boats, canvas shoes, etc. Cross is at present wholly engaged in keeping the boat painted red. While he decorates one side the other is kept bare for him by the loose trousers of the passerby. Our pants all appear to be of the same material now—at least they are all red.</p>
<p>Light snow, sun obscured. I have not yet seen the sun. Henry discovered a fly in the vessel of rum that has been placed in the observatory to show the effect of low temperatures. It must have been blown from the cracks of the observatory where it has probably lain since the structure was made in “God’s country.”</p>
<p>Some members of the party — strange to say — go much further to explain the presence of the insect. They all agree however that the fly’s lives had “fallen in pleasant places”. Brainard has found a petrification.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thursday-march-2nd-1882">Thursday March 2nd 1882</h2>
<p>I start with Connell and Ellis to see if the musk ox meat there is alright. A cold tramp took us to the tripod I erected last autumn; but instead of two fine carcasses I left suspended there, there was two skeletons of great value, no doubt, to the anatomist, but of no value to us, nicely prepared by the wolves and foxes.</p>
<p>Not wishing to have our trip entirely without any useful result, I hauled a bag of coal from the mine down to the ice foot. We arrived at the Station at 5 p.m. Dr. Pavy, Linn and Henry have brought in the petrification which appears to be the section of a large pine tree. This is an opening for all manner of conjectures as regards the former condition of this region — now so completely barren of vegetation.</p>
<p>Lt. Kislingbury and Israel go to Mt. Campbell. They saw a hare but did not get within range. Long returns at 5 pm: states that Lt. Lockwood and party started to cross the channel at Beechy this morning. Temp. Min: -35.8, Max: -27.6, Mean:-</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="friday-march-3rd-1882">Friday March 3rd 1882</h2>
<p>No sun today. I therefore gave up my notion of ascending Cairn Hill. Light snow during the afternoon. Bender is better. Connell was out hunting. More red paint. Temp Min: -36.5 Max: -26.5, Mean: -31.7</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="saturday-march-4th-1882">Saturday March 4th 1882</h2>
<p>Cloudy and sunny weather today. Biederbeck and I walked to Dutch Island and returned about 4 p.m. It was then quite stormy in the Straits.</p>
<p>No sun — Dr.&nbsp;asked me to walk after dinner and he talked over plans for the North trip — see private journal — -Max:- 32.1 , - Min: 38.6, Mean: -34.9</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sunday-march-5th-1882">Sunday March 5th 1882</h2>
<p>It snowed last night but cleared up this morning and Dr.&nbsp;Pavy and Linn with dog team and driver Jens started for Cape Sumner Greenland to carry provisions for the use of the sledging party which will go in that direction. They started at 7:45 a.m. Connell and I started up Cairn Hill to get a view of the strait. We had a cold time of it the temperature was about -40 and a good breeze blowing making the cold almost unbearable. I would sooner endure -70 and calm than have -25 and the air in motion, Whistler and Salor walked around Bellot Island.</p>
<p>While on Cairn Hill with Connell I saw the glorious sun for the first time in 142 days. Old Sol has been due for 6 or 7 days, but the bad weather, has kept from me the pleasure of seeing him. Although I am the only member of the party who did not see it on the 28th Feb.</p>
<p>It was a glorious sight that can only be appreciated by those who have passed through a long night of four months. See something slushy on this subject in private diary this date. A quite dreary Sunday night, snowy and drifting outside and thoughts of home and friends crowding thick and fast upon us as we listened around the fire.</p>
<p>Temp Max: -28.6 Min: -44.1, Mean: -36.04</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="monday-march-6th-1882">Monday March 6th 1882</h2>
<p>Storm still continues. As soon as the snow ceased to fall a party dragged the small boat “Discovery” — one left by the English out to Distant Cape. We are certainly fortunate in the selection of winter quarters here.</p>
<p>The wind was (blowing) but one mile per hour while at the same time the anemometer at Dutch Island registered 22 miles an hour. Temp -27.0, -36.5., 30.18</p>

<p>Lt. Kislingbury shot two hares today. The light is increasing daily. At 5 a.m. this is quite a bright twilight. Temp. Min: -44.7, Max: -22.8, Mean: -37.0</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thursday-february-9th-1882">Thursday February 9th 1882</h2>
<p>The light steadily increasing and has suggested the coming field work. Lt. Greely therefore inaugurates the preparation for it by setting Bender to work making spirit lamps and cooking utensils. Fredericks our saddler is set to work experimenting with foot gear. This is rendered necessary by our almost total destitution of anything suitable for traveling on the sledge journeys that are contemplated. After much discussion and cussin’ they decide on a combination of canvas and blanket (see private journal). Biederbeck is rolling piles of wire. Beautiful effect of land of polar Clouds. Lt. Greely favors us with a lecture on “Storms”. Temp. Max. -47.1 min. - 54.8, Mean -50.60</p>

<section id="friday-february-10th-1882" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="friday-february-10th-1882">Friday February 10th 1882</h2>
<p>Nothing noteworthy occurs. The extreme low temperature ceases to Provoke any comments. Temp for 24 hours today was -50°.below zero, Max. -51.1, Min.-54.1, Mean -52.40</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="saturday-february-11th-1882">Saturday February 11th 1882</h2>
<p>At 2 a.m. I happened to be awake and the observer on duty informed me that the thermometer corrected —stood (at) —Sixty -60°1. Difference of temperature between inside and out over 110° ! I spent the day in experimenting with some lamps—finding the shortest time in which they would melt ice, etc.</p>

<section id="sunday-february-12th-1882" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sunday-february-12th-1882">Sunday February 12th 1882</h2>
<p>Our usual Sabbath—distinguished from the other days of the week by Bible readings in the morning and rum at night. The latter infuses a little harmless hilarity which finds vent in some chorus singing and violin music.</p>
<p>The weather still continues cold. (See private journal this date)</p>
</section>
<section id="monday-february-13th-1882" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="monday-february-13th-1882">Monday February 13th 1882</h2>
<p>A very busy day—the coldest also. Lt. Lockwood, Ralston and Brainard went to Bellot Island to read the meteorological instruments left there. I tested some nine of Bender’s spirit lamp and got satisfactory results from some of the them. About the time Lt. Lockwood and the party were expected back I started out with Frederick and the dog team to meet them. Missed them as they took a new route back.</p>
<p>Lt. Greely has been experimenting to discover the rapidity with which sound travels in this country. I assisted him by discharging firearms at a distance of a mile and a half mile from him. He noted the flash and catches the sound, recording the same with aid of chronograph. 1 mile 4 1/2 sec: 1/2 mile 2 1/4.</p>
<p>In the evening Lt. Greely conversed with me in regard to my going out on sledge trips in the spring. He was good enough to say I could have command of party supporting Lt. Lockwood—an important mission in his estimation. The Dr.&nbsp;has for some time expressed a strong wish to have me accompany him and I am more desirous of going North on this side than of following the Greenland coast on the other. I think the chances of attaining the highest latitude are greater, I so expressed myself and Lt. Greely kindly allowed me to choose.</p>
<p>For particulars—private journal this date. I spent the evening in reading Hayes the most charming writer of arctic literature I have yet read.</p>

<section id="tuesday-february-14th-1882" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tuesday-february-14th-1882">Tuesday February 14th 1882</h2>
<p>St.&nbsp;Valentine’s day: probably the most remarkable anniversary of the day that any of us experienced. Our mail did not arrive: so our love missives and caricatures did not arrive in time to awaken our affections or wound our vanity. I hauled ice and experimented further with sound.</p>
</section>
<section id="wednesday-february-15th-1882" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wednesday-february-15th-1882">Wednesday February 15th 1882</h2>
<p>More experiments with the shotgun and chronograph. The results of our experiments will not, I fear, throw much light on the science of acoustics.</p>
<p>In using the guns at this low temperature we have found that all the oil must be removed from all parts of them as it freezes and will not allow the weapon to work.</p>
<p>One of our Nimrods was greatly chagrined to find on drawing bead on 4 hare—that the trigger could not be pulled. The hare walked leisurely off while he was frantically trying to get his gun off.</p>
<p>Jens shoots a hare. It is a much larger animal than I supposed: in fact I believe that the hares are larger than the foxes in this part of the world.</p>
<p>In the eve I was out with Dr.&nbsp;Pavy and Lt. Kislingbury (see private journal). I hauled ice with Jens and the dogs during the day. Weather still cold.</p>
</section>
<section id="thursday-february-16th-1882" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thursday-february-16th-1882">Thursday February 16th 1882</h2>
<p>Brainard and Cross go to Bellot Island and hare-hunting: but do not bag any. Frederick the Esquimaux has better luck bringing back a fine specimen. After Jens and I our usual quantities of ice, he, Jens, emulates Frederick’s example and returns with a duplicate hare. Hare stew in prospective. The light is daily increasing: the cold weather still continues however.</p>
</section>
<section id="friday-february-17th-1882" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="friday-february-17th-1882">Friday February 17th 1882</h2>
<p>I make some further experiments with some new tinware of Jakay’s. I note time required to melt ice, boil the water, raise same in upper tin to given temperature, etc. I also note the amt alcohol used. The results were generally satisfactory. I hauled ice as usual; in fact I would dislike to give up this 2 hours exercise with the dog teams. It is both exhilarating and healthful. The dogs are a never failing source of interest to me. The more one uses them the better does he appreciate their usefulness and intelligence. I am getting so I can use the whip quite effectively: and succeed in communicating the strange sounding words with which the Esquimaux guide them— with some degree of resemblance to Jens. I still, however, elicit a provoking smile from the superior “whip.”</p>

<section id="saturday-february-18th-1882" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="saturday-february-18th-1882">Saturday February 18th 1882</h2>
<p>Brainard yesterday ascertained that 2,200 lbs of the musk oxen meat still remains. This is agreeable intelligence as the meat is excellent and while it lasts we will laugh at scurvy.</p>
<p>Nothing noteworthy occurs today.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;informs me that he has requested of Lt. Greely that I accompany him North. Dog driving is now something that I must give more attention than ever as the event may occur when the accomplishment will be something more than ornamental.</p>
</section>
<section id="sunday-february-19th-1882" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sunday-february-19th-1882">Sunday February 19th 1882</h2>
<p>Our usual Sunday. The first step towards active field work was the departure of Lt. Lockwood, Brainard, Frederick and dog team (8) for Beechy. A cold trip it must prove to be.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Pavy and I take a walk to Dutch Island. —see private journal— I find that I have overworked my eyes: have read too much. I must discontinue for a time. It is however difficult to keep from reading during these cold dark days when there is little else to do. I presume I have read at least six hours per day all winter.</p>
</section>
<section id="monday-february-20th-1882" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="monday-february-20th-1882">Monday February 20th 1882</h2>
<p>A very cool morning. The light is increasing so that I thought I would try my luck with a shotgun today. Whistler and I started for Watercourse Bay. In the ravine leading to the coal mine we startled up a fine large hare which I followed for miles, succeeded in getting within about 75 yards of him and risked a shot but without effect. The strangest part of the affair was the manner in which the little animal traveled: he stood perfectly upright, kangaroo like, and hopping on his hind legs made enormous strides. Not until he started to ascend the side of the ravine did he assume his proper position of a quadruped.</p>
<p>We passed some time at the grotto mentioned by Mr.&nbsp;Hodson in his interesting article that appeared in the “Frasier’s” after the return of the British expd’n in 1876. It came fully up to our expectations.</p>
<p>On our return we again startled our hare and I persistently followed it by the failing light until it disappeared entirely. It began to snow slightly as we came through the gap and it was difficult to prevent faces from freezing. Whistler’s face was frozen repeatedly and it took some time to remove the frost—J. R. Lt G —see private journal—</p>
<p>My eyes still trouble me.</p>

<p>I hauled ice as usual. Two of our pups have died. Schneider disconsolate. Weather still keeps very cold. We are making preparations for the celebration of Washington’s Birthday tomorrow. I found my weight still holds good—175 lbs.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wednesday-february-22nd-1882">Wednesday February 22nd 1882</h2>
<p>The patriotic Americans among us have some opportunity of expressing loyal sentiments today. Lt. Greely in honor of the day arranged to have it spent as a holiday. An especially palatable dinner was prepared and to diversify the eating exercise we had a shooting match and snow shoe race.</p>
<p>Lt. Greely favored us with a lecture of the “Father of Our Country”. See private journal.</p>
<p>Lt. Lockwood and Brainard return from Beechy. They were engaged in extending the dimensions of the snowhouse there so as to make it accommodate the large parties that will rendezvous there during the spring sledging trips.</p>
<p>The commanding officer called me and I learned some details of the prospective spring work. –see private journal this date.</p>

<p>This morning while I was hauling ice with Jens and the dog team the temperature was as low as -60 on the ice floe. This temperature — strange to say—is not difficult to stand for a few hours while exercising violently. Of course it required much care to preserve nose and cheeks from freezing.</p>

<p>Weather still continuing cold. Lt. Greely favors us with a lecture on “The Poles” which | did not have the pleasure of hearing as I was assisting Israel at the observatory.</p>
<p>He has so much trouble and difficulty in manipulating the instruments and freezing his fingers that I thought I might save him some of it by sending the signals of time over the telephone for him. I was not of much service however. Israel’s work is very hard in adjusting the transit, he inadvertently froze his nose against the frosty instrument. While we were there the temp stood -45.

<p>Today we experienced the most severe storm I have ever witnessed. Barometer began to fall a little after midnight, 15th, a light breeze setting in from the west at that time. Sky clouded up at this time a small space at the zenith only being partly clear so that a few stars could be seen shining through. Barometer showing more decided fall as the morning advanced. At 8 a.m. slight fall of snow began wind sprang up from SW, blowing 4 miles an hour. The remarkable fall of barometer induced Lt. Greely to have it observed every 15 minutes. About now the expected storm came in full force, Ralston who was on duty found great difficulty in reaching the instrument shelter when the violence of the wind blew out his candle. He returned and Jewell accompanied him. They succeeded in reading the thermometer of -12° 5 a remarkable rise of 17 ° 8 since 7 a.m. Brainard read the tide gauge. By the time 1 o’clock came round the storm had so increased in violence that although several relays and relief parties attempted to reach the instrument shelter none were successful. Connell and] started for the tide gauge but had not struggled through the blinding drift before our lantern was extinguished and we were compelled to return to the Station. I cannot describe the fury of the storm. It was intensely dark, the wind was howling out of the N.E. at the rate of 60 miles an hour carrying with it clouds of frozen snow that cut the face like powdered glass or sparks of fire. The resistance to the body was tremendous, it was impossible to move in an upright position. We lost the path and tumbled over the hill to the ice foot making no attempt to save ourselves. On returning two volunteers joined us and we started again with a red signal lamp. It was Brainard and Biederbeck who accompanied us, their success at 12 o’clock causing them to (?) our attempt. We all stumbled precariously over the bank but could not find the path. We crawled along a short distance when someone behind me said “Let’s try and get back.” Biederbeck’s red light showed up a little in advance however and we followed it and succeeded by mere chance in reaching the snow house over the tide gauge. Our return was not quite so difficult but we had hard work and returned to the quarters bruised and almost frozen. Our faces were covered with a sheet of ice. Observations were now discontinued at the shelter and a thermometer was exposed at the side of our building near the door. At 2:30 p.m. the anemometer cups were blown away. Several tents were blown down and other damage done. The highest velocity recorded before the anemometer blew away was 65 miles but there is not doubt it increased afterwards and we are inclined to think 80 miles per hour not too high an estimate. It was during a lull just before 12 o’clock that the winds shifted around to N.E. where it remained during the remainder of the storm. It ceased to blow with great violence after 4 o’clock but a stiff breeze was felt all day as soon as the observation at the instrument shelter and the tidal gauge resumed. Life lines were placed for the guidance of the observer.</p>
<p>Temp -11° .0 to -31°.1 obs. and corrected</p>

<p>This morning we were smoked out at an early hour by the pipe of our stove choking up. Our heating arrangements are very poor, a good deal of gas is (?) and we breathe much more of it than is compatible with health, especially as we have to spend so much time indoors during the long and cold arctic night. As I note this the sooty comets are falling on me and my surroundings. (see further remarks in private journal)</p>

<p>The period for monthly magnetic observations has come around and as Israel is still engaged with the pendulum Ralston and Jewell will make the magnetic obs. leaving the regular meteorological work to Henry and I. I find it very tiresome and tedious work—hourly observations, 8 hours on and 8 off. Routine work never suited me.</p>
<p>An auroral arch was observed at 7:35 and strong magnetic disturbances disappeared at 8:30 and another brilliant arch flashed out at 10:30 but disappeared instantly. -34.1 to -43.7 Obs. &amp; Corrected. Gardiner’s 25th birthday. High tide 89 inches.</p>

<p>Pendulum observations continued. Israe] sticks very faithfully to the work which is very difficult. Some New England rum supposed to be 10 above proof was exposed when I went on duty at midnight and 1 made the following observations regarding the effect of the low temperatures on it. At 2 a.m. a thin coating of slush formed on it—temp -41.7, at 3. slush 1/2 inch in thickness at -44 temp. I again examined it at 5 a.m. and found that it had thickened to the bottom of the vessel resembling somewhat snow saturated with water. Our highest tide was observed today 8 feet 6 inches. The highest observed by the Discovery while here was between 6 and 9 feet. Temp obs. and cor. -31.8 to -47.4 Cross’ birthday.</p>

Snow ceased falling at 3 p.m. It being Xmas eve the presents kindly sent by some thoughtful parties in the States were distributed by our commander amid much chaffing and sport.

In the evening an extra quantity of the (?) in the form of New England rum was issued the exhilarating effect of which added to the pleasure of looking over the fine illustrations in some London Graphics of a late date enabled us to pass a very enjoyable evening. It was impossible however to prevent our minds from wandering over snow and ice to the homes of friends and loved ones so vividly brought before us by the season of Christmastide.

<p>Lt. snow during the afternoon. Lt Greely issued an order for all hands to return at 11 p.m. as he considers it demoralizing to sleep at all times as we do now, as there is no difference in the appearance of night and day.</p>

<p>Our usual Sabbath, differing very little from the other days of the week. Lt. Greely read the passage which is usually read at the opening of Congress this being the day on which the event occurs. In the evening several of the cavalrymen gave a very amusing imitation of the Indian war dance as they have seen it on the Frontier. The falling of a remarkably bright was observed at 6:30 p.m. accompanied by a very loud report. Auroral displays were seen at intervals during the day; at some times in the form of streamers and at others in a curtain formation. They were of remarkable brilliance. At 2:30. we observed the brightest arch that has been seen since our arrival.</p>

<p>Today Jens the Esquimaux concluded he would vary the monotony of our life by absconding. His elopement was discovered at breakfast time. He had been seen in the early morning however and we naturally concluded that he had not traveled far. After breakfast Lt. Greely instructed Brainard and I to start from a point outside the Station and by walking in opposite directions discovered (Jens) tracks leading from the Station.</p>
<p>It was about 8:30 a.m. when we started. Henry volunteered to go with me and Whistler went with Brainard. It was very dark, the sky overcast and no moon in the heavens. Fortunately for Jens light snow had fallen the day previous so that his tracks could be easily found and distinguished from others. I soon found his tracks following the beaten track towards Dutch Island. We communicated with Brainard and Whistler who soon found us and we proceeded at a rapid rate expecting to overtake the fugitive in a short time as the track looked fresh and we knew that he had been very long on the road. After proceeding a short distance we thought it best to send back word to the Station to follow us with a dog team in case Jens should lead us a long chase. Henry and Frederick the other Esquimaux returned.</p>
<p>Brainard Whistler and I followed the trail expecting to catch up to Jens at any moment for we could see unaided by any lights he had not been able to follow the path directly but wavered on and off. With our lanterns we moved on very rapidly until Dutch Island distant two miles was reached. Beyond that point the path is not well defined as it has not been traveled since the last party came in from Cape Beechy. We saw that our game had turned off at right angles towards the ice foot so as to follow the coastline and avoid being lost in the ice. His track now became difficult to follow much time being lost in keeping (?) of them. When about five miles from the home we were joined by Dr.&nbsp;Pavy with Frederick and dog team. We kept on at the most rapid rate practicable, two of us going in advance with the lantern, the others following the track as we found it. The ice foot was very rough and the darkness was so intense that it was impossible to select the most favorable route for the sledge even if the erratic course taken by Jens allowed for it. When near Distant Cape the progress was very slow and at one place I dropped behind to allow the Dr.&nbsp;a better position behind the sledge. We had been walking behind it intending to join him as soon as the point was passed. I had just left the advance and being able to hold on to the standards of the sledge and depend upon it for guidance. I blew out the candle in my lantern to economize our light. As soon as I dropped behind, the sledge disappeared in the dark and in groping my way after it I met with several severe falls. I did not go far before I slipped and was thrown violently against a projecting piece of ice. It was several minutes before I could move from my prone position on the ice, when I discovered that my shoulder was undoubtedly broken. I regained my footing and appreciating the importance of catching up with the sledge, I lit my candle under great difficulty presented by the wind and the use of one hand only. I started at the best gait I could suffering intensely and encountered several more falls in one of which my light went out and delayed me. I expected the sledge to wait for me at the moment they discovered my absence. It appeared they were so interested in the chase that my absence was not noticed or they thought I was following at my leisure. I plotted along my candle burnt out. I overtook the party at a point a little south of Cape Murchison distant about ten miles to reach while our (treacherous) way traveled much farther. They had just concluded to wait for me. On learning (of) my condition Whistler started to return with me.</p>
<p>Brainard and the Dr.&nbsp;continuing in the way intending to go as far as Cape Beechy and spending the night at the snowhouse if they did not find Jens. Whistler and I made but slow progress on the return as 1 was compelled to avoid jarring my shoulder. When near Distant Cape Whistler began to complain of the cold, a few moments after he began to talk incoherently and before a mere halfway to Dutch Island he was delirious. My position was becoming rather unpleasant. Whistler overcome by the cold, was entirely unresponsive and it took all my will and ingenuity to induce him to walk. He was continually falling down and could hardly resist the temptation to remain on the ice. I attempted to lead him and having no light our footing was so uncertain that I was continually jarred by missteps which caused me to suffer intensely from my shoulder. I had to cajole, coax and command Whistler at every step to get him along. I began to fear for his life: had he refused to move he might have died in a very few moments.</p>
<p>We got as far as Dutch Island when Dr.&nbsp;Pavy, Brainard and the Esquimaux overtook us with the dog sledge. I at once gave the Dr.&nbsp;the state of affairs and told him it was necessary to get Whistler to the Station as soon as possible. It was necessary to make him run behind the sledge and we learned on reaching the Station that when near the Station they had to place him on the sledge as he had lost all use of his limbs.</p>
<p>Brainard and I reached the Station at 4 p.m.</p>
<p>We had been out about 8 hours, traveled at least twenty miles with the temperature at -30 on one of the darkest days of the winter. Whistler was delirious for several hours, his nose and cheeks frozen but otherwise he suffered no bad consequences. Dr.&nbsp;examined my shoulder and found fracture not complete but the bone evidently cracked and ligature injured. Jens was overtaken a short distance beyond the point from which we started to return. He came back quite penitently but did not attempt to explain the cause of his strange conduct. Light snow was falling almost all day.</p>

<p>A few days ago Lt. Greely requested me to try and arrange some sort of entertainment as a diversion for the party the time hanging heavily on our hands at present. I found it impossible to carry out any such plan successfully as our party is so small that after making a cast of performers there would be but a small audience remaining. Then it would be impossible to rehearse or arrange anything except in the presence of the others so by the time of the performance the programme would be stale and uninteresting. I therefore gave up the idea but suggested to the men that we should invite Lt. Greely to lecture before us. They were pleased with the suggestions and I made our wishes known to Lt. Greely. He kindly assisted and tonight favored us with some interesting remarks on the Polar question: a subject absorbing to us at present. An Aurora observed at 8p.m.</p>

<p>The party are exercising by banking up magnetic observatory. My shoulder is very painful; sleep is almost an impossibility. Frederick the other Esquimaux has exhibited the desire to follow the example of Jens. In a melodramatic manner he flourished a huge wooden cross in one hand and with the other on his heart bade us all “good bye” intimating that he was tired of life and about to immolate himself on the Shrine of the Polar Question. We dissuaded him however. Temperature Max -27.4° F Min -46.2° F</p>

<p>I took up the duty of making the hourly observations again at midnight. The most difficult part of the tour is that leading to the tidal gauge. We are compelled to descend the steep bank to the ice foot and notwithstanding the quantity of ashes sprinkled in the path it is slippery and unsafe. I’ve had several severe falls, the heavy cork sole shoes adding to the uncertainty of the footing. Ralston has demolished several of Bender’s tin candle lanterns by falling on them. We have accused him of tobogganing on them after the style of the Montreal club. The weather is becoming warmer.</p>

<p>Temperature increasing. Weather fair. I did not state that Sgts. Ralston and Brainard visited Mt. Campbell on Bellot Island for the purpose of reading the anemometer and thermometer placed there permanently. The anemometer has registered 657 miles since it was first placed in position on Oct 9th. Thermometer showed minimum temp since Oct 31st to have been -38°0. Temperature of water and thickness of ice in harbor: temp air -27, surface of water -29.1 Depth of 33 ft. 29°.2 Thickness of ice 33” Snow began falling at 11:35 a.m. ending at 5:30 p.m</p>

<p>Weather clear except a short time at midday. Jewell is on duty again. Gardiner is getting along very nice and hauled ice in morning. Frederick the Eskimo has for some time appeared disheartened and has been making me the confidant of his gloomy prospects, such as that of running away. Some days since Jens acted in the same manner but we reassured them of their safety and security. They have both been treated with the greatest kindness by all the party but as there has been little for them to do for some time past they have become lonesome and homesick and doubtless imagine all manner of things. As Frederick appeared to be very much in earnest today I sat up at night to intercept any attempt on his part to escape.</p>

<p>A beautiful Lunar halo with mock moons was observed at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>The most interesting occurrence of the day was the lunar eclipse of the moon which commenced about 10 a.m. and lasted for over an hour. It was almost a total eclipse and the moon during the time exhibited different colors. An auroral streamer was observed. (diagram)</p>

<p>Nothing of importance occurred to vary the monotony of our everyday or night life. The usual exercise taken by the party is walking, hauling ice, working in the pendulum shelter. This work lasts for an hour or two each day. The hauling of ice falls to me and I shall be loath to give it up as it furnishes me with healthful exercise much more exhilarating and beneficial than mere walking on account of the activity required in following the sledge and assisting the Esquimaux in managing the dogs. Weather fair. Lunar halo observed.</p>

<p>The weather’s still cold. Several acids and oils were placed in the instrument shelter to determine the relative freezing point. They all became much denser in a short time. Coal oil assumed the consistency of syrup.</p>
<p>Light snow 3:45 p.m. to 11 p.m.</p>
<p>“Lt. Greely today issued order No 9 to the effect that Thursday Nov 24 will be set apart as a day of Thanksgiving corresponding with the day observed as a holiday in the United States.

<p>I hauled some ice this morning, although the moon has disappeared there is significant light to work by. Lt. Lockwood with two men was engaged in finishing the ice house in the harbor which was commenced some time ago. It is proposed to use it as a shelter for a self-registering tide gauge.</p>
<p>In laying the foundation of pendulum piers the temperature of the earth at a depth of 18 inches was found to be 7°.0, the temp of air — 5.0. This is in the shed or lean-to adjoining officers quarters.</p>

<p>Brainard and Cross were experimented this morning on the feasibility of lighting a short rifle range artificially for the use of the marksmen in the coming Thanksgiving. They found that at 25 yds good light could be thrown on a target and also sufficient for sighting the gun.</p>
<p>The pendulum piers are now sufficiently high; and the erection of an ice house over them was commenced today. Weather clear, an aurora was observed at 9 a.m. It disappeared in short time; was of ribbon formation.The cooks are making great preparations for tomorrow’s dinner with the exception of the regulation turkey the menu is of the real Thanksgiving flavor.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thursday-november-24th-1881">Thursday, November 24th 1881</h2>
<p>The day clear and favorable for the sports to be engaged in. Of course the drawbacks of darkness and cold must be taken into consideration. We are unfortunately in the dark period of the moon the presence of which would supply us with all the light we would require. Thermometer over 60 below the freezing point making this doubtless the coldest Thanksgiving day that has ever been celebrated.</p>
<p>At an early hour the men were all engaged in perfecting their arrangements for the different races; the cooks preparing their (hands?) and even the dogs making noisy demonstrations as if to show that they too entered into the spirit of the day.</p>
<p>After breakfast the first thing on the programme was the snowshoe race. It was called for 10 am: but for an hour before that time the clattering of the shoes could be heard through the quarters as the men tested the security of the fastenings. We all repaired to the course on the ice in harbor which was staked out and very imperfectly lighted. The distance was 200 yds and return. Eight competitors entered and a good start was effected. And now the affair became most amusing to the bystanders. Many of the men were not familiar with the cumbersome footgear and this added to the difficulty of finding the way over the ill light course, made their progress most awkward and erratic. The “Montreal Snowshoe Club” would have considered it a strange exhibition. An unperceived piece of ice would trip some luckless fellow up and away he would go floundering in the snow to serve as a footmat for his impetuous rivals who were following him with more haste than speed.</p>
<p>As soon as the unfortunate could recover his 2 x 4 feet he would probably be run into by some fleet footed Mercury who could not distinguish him from the surrounding snow in which he had been wallowing. Many were the mishaps before the goal was reached.</p>
<p>Sgts. Brainard, Ralston, Gardiner came in and won the first three prizes. They reached the home stake in the order in which they are named.</p>
<p>Prizes were: 1st Bot of pres. Peaches: 1 gill rum, (towel) and soap. 2nd 1 gill rum, towel and soap</p>
<p>We then repaired to the quarters where bets were settled and paid and other wagers laid on the result of the approaching running race. I found myself the winner of a large amount of tobacco (our legal tender) having backed Brainard against Gardiner, who was the favorite.</p>
<p>I acted as stakeholder for the party and in that capacity handed over a large amount of tobacco to the lucky gamblers.</p>
<p>The running race footrace now came up and after a tie between three of the six contestants it was soon over and the first place won by Ellis, Henry second and Linn third. Prizes; 1st 1 pt.&nbsp;rum, towel and soap, 2nd 1 gill rum and towel, 3rd 1/2 gill and soap.</p>
<p>The rifle shooting came last and most of the party engaged in it. Henry won the first prize (bot of pres. peaches, 1/2 pt rum and soap), Jens 2nd (1 gill rum, towel and soap) and Cross 3rd 1/2 gill rum and soap. (over) We were much interested in the result of the dog driving match between the two Esquimaux. They were made to understand it perfectly i.e.&nbsp;the arrangement, and set about harnessing up the dogs. While they were doing so we went inside the quarters expecting to be notified when they were in readiness so that we might see and regulate the start. However the canine Jehus took the matter in their own hands. We discovered they had gone and patiently awaited their return. They came in shortly at a terrific pace Frederick ahead thus winning the pipe and half pound of tobacco constituting the prize.</p>
<p>Three auroral streamers were observed.</p>
<p>We were now ready for dinner which was served at 4 o’clock. I give here the bill of fare which considering our distance from market was varied and palatable.</p>
<p>Our chef de cuisine excelled himself:</p>
<p>(Oyster soup, crabs, lobster salad, Eider Ducks, boiled ham, green corn, lima beans, asparagus, jelly cake, fruit and sponge cakes, Peach pie, blueberry pie, vanilla ice cream, coffee, warm biscuit, nuts figs etc.) After dinner grog was issued larger quantity than usual and songs were in order.</p>
<p>Lt. Greely having appointed me distributor of the prizes I attached the said role of each of the party and succeeded in getting up a most ridiculous dress suit for the occasion: an old long tailed coat of Jewell’s was transformed by the use of shears into a swallow tail of remarkable pattern, a dilapidated white vest, immense collar, profuse jewelry manufactured by the tinsmith, and an immense pair of Esquimaux boots completed the costume. Lt. Greely made us a short address after which I conferred the prizes.</p>

<p>In chronicling our celebration of yesterday I lost sight of the fact that the first number of our paper was issued yesterday. It made a very good appearance and we the editors, thought it interesting. It was little appreciated however, by the majority of the party. Henry’s department was the personal column and some of his lists although perfectly harmless gave great offense to those who were alluded to. The bully Whistler as usual made a complete ass of himself. Frederick also considered himself greatly aggrieved. Although contributions had been solicited there was no response except from Lt. Greely who sent in a short letter over “Occasional.” For my part of the sheet see “Arctic Moon” of date Nov 24” editorial Arctic Moon account of Lt. K’s kindness to dogs Wrangle Bay trip, (?) from the Esquimaux, etc. Lt. Lockwood furnished the preamble and heroic account of and adventure of Lt. Kislingbury and Dr Pavy.</p>
<p>An Auroral arch was observed at 6:45 and other at 9:55 a.m. The latter was the most beautiful, exceedingly bright and of a delicate pale yellow color. Weather clear. Temperature low.</p>

<p>Temperature low. Cross while taking a walk had his ear frozen. Lt. Kislingbury and I walked to Dutch Island as a constitutional. Notwithstanding the exercise of great care on my part I froze one of my cheeks.</p>
<p>At 10 a.m. an auroral streamer was seen.</p>
<p>The laugh is decided against Sgt.&nbsp;Brainard today. He started with two or three companions to walk to Dutch Island, which by the way, is the objective point of all pedestrians, the intervening path being well beaten, and was not aware that the two Eskimos had preceded him. It is very dark now and they had proceeded but half way when by the dim light they saw what they supposed to be a pack of ravenous wolves emerging from the ice hummocks and making for them. They were unarmed but Brainard with great coolness told his companions to get their knives in readiness and prepared to repel the onslaught of the ferocious beasts. Hastily opening their knives some of them insignificant pen knives they stood in an agony of suspense until the near approach of the animals proved them to be dogs that had accompanied the Eskimos and had started on in advance to meet the new party with demonstrations of delight and no belligerent intention whatever.</p>

<p>Several appearances of auroral light were observed today. Temperature low. I hauled six loads of ice with the Eskimos and dog team. This furnished me with an amount of exercise which is beneficial, but arduous. I find the dogs more interesting than one would suppose. They exhibit remarkable sagacity and intelligence. Nothing, however, can overcome their propensities for fighting. During the couple of hours I was engaged with them I noticed nine different encounters which were usually general, no non-combatants to be seen.</p>
<p>They have divided into two parties and it does not appear possible to associate one party with the other. I was only using one team and the other apparently jealous of the preference shown the first barred the road at every point where it was possible and contended the passage of the loaded sledge. I was compelled to precede the team and drive them off. Lunar halo and mock moons were seen at 3:30 p.m. They presented a beautiful appearance.</p>

<p>During the day the temperature fell to -43°. The Mercury froze at -37°.9. While taking the 3 p.m. observation Gardiner while on his way to the tidal gauge fell and fractured his leg above the ankle. I finished his tour and will take his place at midnight. Being desirous of completing my knowledge of German and Biederbeck wishing to improve his English we have made an arrangement by which we shall interchange instructions in our mother tongues. We had our first lesson this evening.</p>

<p>I forgot to state in yesterday’s entry that on our way back we found “Gypsy” safe and sound. She had increased her progeny to triplets. We wrapped them all in deer skin and brought them in on the sledge. After arriving at Beechy and while we were feeding the dogs, one of the pups fell out and before we noticed it, became partly frozen and afterwards died. Spent comfortable night and started for home 12 a.m. Shortly after we started it began to snow and the track along the icefoot was difficult to follow. In crossing St.&nbsp;Patrick’s Bay we lost the track. Lt. Kislingbury and the Dr.&nbsp;considered us as going too far into the Strait, while I contended that we were already too far up the bay. We found ourselves among hummocks and I left the sledge and proceeded ahead. I persisted in keeping out in the mouth of the bay and at last found the old track. We arrived at home station at 7 p.m. Learned that Lt. Lockwood and party had only arrived a few hours earlier. They found it impossible to cross the Strait on account of the moving ice in channel and also the soft slushy ice that would neither bear a foot passenger or allow boat to pass was another impediment. They started for home from Beechy on the 7th when near the entrance of St.&nbsp;Patrick’s Bay they found the icefoot overflowed with the exceptionally high tide they had that day. Most of the party got their feet wet and wanted to go into camp at once. Lt. L. however advised keeping on till Cape Murchison was reached. As soon as they could examine their feet several found them badly frozen. Biederbeck was dragged in on the sledge and will probably loose his great toe.</p>

<p>I have concluded to omit the entry of the daily temperatures until the comparative readings now being made will furnish us with a correction for the thermometers. At present the readings are considered slightly incorrect by Lt. Greely. I will afterwards enter them as —–notes. Today the weather is clearing, with falling temperatures. No aurora was observed.</p>

<p>The parties are engaged for a short time each day in outdoor work. Some remove the ice forming on the tide gauge; others bank up the house etc. I spent about an hour each day in hauling ice with Jens and a team of dogs. The ice is for conversion into water for daily use. An aurora was observed early this morning, also a faint streamer in the evening. A lunar halo of 22° was seen at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Considerable excitement over two fires that occurred today. The first was insignificant occurring in the lean to while Saler was filling lamps. The one caught fire but was smothered before any damage done. About 4 p.m. Ellison was in the carpenter tent and attempted the experiment of filling a gasoline lamp without extinguishing it. He made a very successful failure, but will not likely again try it. In an instant he was enveloped in flames the whole can of fluid igniting. He rushed out shouting “Fire!” Our two Babcock extinguishers were brought into (?) and after a short time the fire was subdued but not before some more tools and clothing was destroyed. Ellison was badly burned.</p>

<p>Ellison was badly burned. His face and hands are excoriated so that they appear raw. He presents a sorry appearance. Weather is fair. I hauled four loads of ice and will continue to do so until the moon leaves us as after that the light will not be sufficient. Two mock moons were observed from 9:45 to midnight. Weather is growing colder.</p>

<p>Our usual Sabbath varying the routine of the week by its accompanying divine service in morning and issue of grog at night. The day generally spent in reading and sleeping. In the evening some hymns and old songs were sung with a strong chorus. Weather continues to keep fine and clear. Two mock moons appeared at 10:30 p.m. and passed away at midnight. No auroras were observed.</p>

<p>Lt. Greely commenced work on the pendulum piers in the lean-to today. Gardiner and Connell assisted him. They succeeded in getting a good foundation laid using quick plaster of Paris and cement. With the Eskimo and dogs I have hauled my quota of ice; the tide gauge measured the ice formed in the pool at the (?). Auroral streamers now observed at noon and continued at intervals during the afternoon and evening. Sgt.&nbsp;Israel was engaged in taking magnetic observations which continue for three days during each month.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tuesday-nov-1-1881">Tuesday, Nov 1, 1881</h2>
<p>Remarkable deposit of hoar frost noticed by the observers. Sufficient was collected in gages to measure .05 of an inch. This measurement however includes all that has fallen since last snowstorm but most of it fell this morning. I assisted Israel in ascertaining the deep sea temperature.</p>
<p>Preparations going on all day for the attempt to cross over the Strait to Polaris Harbor and “Halls Rest.” The men are exhibiting considerable ingenuity in fitting themselves out. Our supply of clothing and paraphernalia for field work in this climate is sadly deficient of much that is necessary. For foot gear especially we are badly off. The cork soled arctics are much to heavy to walk in, Esquimaux boots we have next to none and those few we have too small. There are not enough of the buckskin moccasins to go around. I have not received a pair as they were issued while I was out in the field. Dr.&nbsp;Pavy generally fits me out from his private store of Esquimaux boots which is extensive.</p>
<p>By evening Lt. Lockwood and his party of seven men completed their preparations packed their sledges with the provisions etc and pulled it out to Distant Cape so as to allow a start in the morning free of the sledge encumbrance…</p>
<p>They returned at 5 p.m. An unusual dinner was prepared by order of Lt. Greely in honor, I presume, of Lt. L’s departure on his hazardous attempt.</p>

<p>Lt. Lockwood and party started this morning for Cape Beechy from which point they propose to pass over to Polaris Bay. The load on sledge, an English one formed here, weighed 1,100 — a heavy drag through the snow and over the icefoot.</p>
<p>I followed at 9:30 with dog sledge and Jens the Esquimaux. The plan is that I am to support Lt. Lockwood, aiding him with the dog team until the arrival of Dr. Pavy when I join him for a trip to Wrangle Bay to carry rations for the spring trip. My team was composed of but 7 dogs as two of the bitches had newly born litters and not the same number of serviceable dogs, 7, were left for the Dr.&nbsp;The load of 600 lbs that we had on the sled was therefore too heavy. I met with the Dr.&nbsp;and Lt. Kislingbury near Dutch Island and arranged with him to leave one bag of bread at Murchisons to be brought on by his team as he expected to have a light load. Overtook the party of Lt. Lockwood at Murchison at 2 p.m. They were plodding along steadily and expected to reach Beechy by night. I furnished them with a drink of chocolate I had brought warm in our sleeping bag and proceeding on advance. I reached Cape Beechy at 7 p.m. and Lt. L and party at 8 p.m. We occupied the snowhouse erected some time ago and were very comfortable I brought but one sleeping bag as it reduced the weight on the sled and Jens the Eskimo and I occupied it.</p>

<p>Slept comfortably last night. Jens and I filled the sleeping bag so that the warmth of our bodies was confined and kept us warm. Temperatures during the night -17.</p>
<p>Lt. Lockwood started out with Jens and the dogs for Cape Murchison to bring two bags of coal. He also intended to examine the small boat left in St.&nbsp;Patrick’s Bay by the English in 1875. I, assisted by Ellis, put out rations and built a snow pedestal for a telescope we had brought. Brainard with rest of party started back for remainder of their load abandoned the night before. Brainard and party returns at 1:30 p.m. Lt. K returns at 4 p.m. He forgot to bring sack of pemmican which was to be part of his load. Mock moons observed at 8 p.m. Temperature -11.</p>

<p>Lt. Lockwood sent me for the boat at St.&nbsp;Patrick’s Bay. Started with dogs and sledge. Returned with boat at 3 p.m. During my absence Lt. L and party made attempt to cross the Straits. They took whale boat which made their load so cumbersome that it was impossible to advance over the rough ice. They consequently returned after a few hours. Lt. L proposes making another attempt with the smaller boat brought from St.&nbsp;P Bay. Dr.&nbsp;Pavy and Lt. K arrived at snowhouse at 6 p.m. They made but slow progress being 12 hours from home station. Dr.&nbsp;is on his way to Wrangle Bay with more rations to be used in the spring campaign. I shall accompany him with the other dog team.</p>

<p>I observed an amusing tableau last night before retiring. The snow house not being large enough to accommodate us all, Ellis Saler and Biederbeck pitched a tent outside and occupied a sleeping bag large enough to hold three men. Ellis and Saler retired and left the candle burning for Biederbeck who was making preparations for cooking breakfast in the morning. I happen to look in the tent and was almost convulsed with laughter to see “Old Mate”, one of the most disagreeable and mangy looking of all the dogs, occupying the middle place in the sleeping bag left vacant for B. He was lying on his side head on the pillow with one paw thrown lovingly over Ellis’ neck. As I laughed he looked up and expression said as plainly as I can interpret it: “It is all right. I am one of them.” At 9:30 Dr.&nbsp;Pavy and I started for Wrangle Bay. Lt. Kislingbury accompanied him with one sledge and team and Jens and I had the other one.</p>
<p>When we left Lt. Lockwood and party were making preparations for crossing the Strait. They are repairing the boat I had brought from Murchison</p>
<p>We proceeded for a short distance when Jens told me that the little bitch “Gypsy” exhibited symptoms of matemity. He tried to drive her back thinking she would return to the snow house but she returned to the team. We then proceeded with her. She soon became tired an ill and we carried her on the sledge. This reduced our teams to six dogs each as three bitches were left at the home station with litters. We had a difficult time traveling over much ground which was also icy. Camped at 7:15 p.m. in the valley.</p>

<p>During the night Gypsy managed to enter the tent and while we were at breakfast gave birth to two pups. After breakfast Jens and I built a small snow house and placed the mother with the pups in it. I left some pemmican so that she would not starve during our absence. We then broke camp and deserted her. 9:30 am. We traveled all day and had a most interesting journey. We found the traveling very good. At about noon we entered the lower ravine leading in a more easterly direction towards Wrangle Bay.</p>
<p>(Drs’ sled) was on a much lower level than the one we were on and we made a most exciting descent into it. Finding our efforts to hold the sledge back to no avail I threw myself on the sledge. Jens dragged by the standards behind. The dogs started on the full run and would not be controlled; the sledge however descended faster than they and running away some rocks the lines became entangled and the sledge stopped. Found good traveling in the lower valley and reached our destination Wrangle Bay at 2:30 p.m. It was then beginning to snow.</p>

<p>Weather fair, a Solar halo was observed between 10 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. The sun has condescended to shine for such a short time each day for a long time. Today Lt. Greely somewhat startled us by announcing that today was the last on which we would see the sun ’till at least the 29th of February. We all rushed out door and sure enough Old Sol only exhibited himself for a few moments and then set in a glorious glow of colors. The refraction of its rays presented a beautiful effect in the horizon for some time after. Ther. ranged from maximum -10 to minimum -27.4.</p>

<p>We were busy for an hour or two building an ice wall around the house. We have been furnished with a few hours exercise every morning in constructing this wall which will afford a shelter from the north wind.

<p>Added another tier to the ice wall. Snyder and Biederbeck while taking a constitutional walk in the evening were somewhat startled by hearing a wolf howling. It was so dark they could not see him but distinctly heard his footsteps in the snow. They were about a mile from the station but did not tarry.

<p>It is now fourteen days since the sun disappeared below the horizon and to test the power of active rays still existing in the faint light reflected from sun at noon I propose to attempt another photograph. Israel, Whistler started after breakfast and took the direction of Distant Cape. We hauled photographic apparatus on Hudson Bay Sledges.</p>
<p>I exposed dry-plate for about one hour about noon. Sun must have been 6° or 8° below horizon. Amused ourselves while plate was exposed—target practice with rifle Whistler had brought along. Our Sunday evenings are generally spent in singing. Lt. Kislingbury, Gardiner, Ellis &amp; Schneider taking prominent parts. Their repertior (sic) consists of old songs and older hymns. I sometimes assist with the violin.</p>
<p>Usual quart of ram dispensed. Said rum is not a particularly delectable article of spirits tasting more like diluted commercial alcohol than anything else. For the first month or more we used the English rum deposited by the Nares expedition at Cape Hawkes and appropriated by us. Our own ‘New England’ is a poor substitute.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thursday-october-6-1881">Thursday October 6, 1881</h2>
<p>Our chief object in visiting the Bellows was to have the muskox meat left by the party in Sept.&nbsp;from the place the cattle had been killed to the icefoot that it might be convenient for a party to take home to camp.</p>
<p>Arose at 6:30 a.m. Cooked breakfast over our alcohol lamp. Minimum temperature recorded -24 during night.</p>
<p>Started for a load of the meat, found it about 2 miles from the shore, and brought down one carcass, a difficult matter to drag the sledge with such a load as the stones were not covered by the snow.</p>
<p>It was very uncomfortable as a strong breeze was blowing causing us to suffer much from the cold. It required the utmost vigilance to prevent our faces and hands from freezing. Brainard had his nose frostbitten several times and despite my caution I had my cheeks frozen. By 4 p.m. we had hauled four loads of the meat to the shore. We then went to the tent and prepared a hasty meal, and at 4:30 started again for another load. At 4 the thermometer read -18 and at 4:20 when we left the tent it registered -20.</p>
<p>Returned at 7p.m. tired out and cold. The thermometer showed us the temperature had fallen to -25° F.</p>

<p>After another uncomfortable night we got up early to bring the last remaining carcass of meat down. Temperature during night -25. Started for home station at 10:40 a.m. Arrived home at 5 p.m. It was then very dark and snowing steadily.”</p>
<p>A footnote “I made one exposure for negatives at “Bellows”.</p>

<p>Light snow falling most of the day. Dr.&nbsp;Pavy and Whistler return from their attempt to reach Cape Joseph Henry at 4:30 p.m. they were unable to reach it owing to the straights being still open and no ice foot on which to travel near Lincoln Bay.</p>
<p>Temperature ranged from +1 to -16. Sunday services and rum as usual.</p>

<p>Weather very thick during day. Snowed from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Lt Lockwood and Sgt.&nbsp;Jewell started to walk to Cape Baird at 8 a.m. Their object is to determine if sledging to that point is practicable. They return at 8:40 p.m. We had become anxious about them as it had become very dark. A party with lanterns met them about 3 miles from camp. Thermometer, Maximum -1, minimum -11.9.</p>

<p>Lt. Lockwood started this morming with three men for the purpose of establishing a depot at Cape Baird. Linn returned at noon with 927 pounds of muskox meat from the Bellows. A Solar halo (mock suns) was observed close to the horizon at 11a.m.</p>
<p>Very low temperature today, the thermometer reads from -8 to -25.9 —rather cool for Indian summer.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thursday-october-13th-1881">Thursday October 13th, 1881</h2>
<p>“Brainard and I started for Mt. Ovibus, distant to base six miles. We rode part of the way with Linn who was on his way to the Bellows after more meat. Mt. Ovibus is estimated to be 2600 ft high. Our object was to reach the summit and examine with the telescope the valley leading from Muskox Bay to see if it offered a practical route to United States range of mountains. We were three hours in making the ascent from base at some places the climbing was most difficult and found a heavy deposit of snow at the top of the mountain. We were forced to use our snowshoes which we fortunately carried. It was my first attempt at walking with such foot gear, and I found I could travel comfortably. We did not accomplish anything as the atmosphere was hazy and could see no distance. Reached home at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Lockwood and party returned at 7:45p.m. Linn got back at noon with the remainder of the Musk Ox meat from the Bellows.</p>
<p>Weather fair- low temperature</p>
<p>Maximum -11.</p>
<p>Minimum -27.4</p>
<p>The above thermometer readings are for the 24 hours froml2 midnight to 12 midnight. The same now applies to all the temperatures I have herein recorded.</p>

<p>Lt. Lockwood started with four men to convey the rations left by Brainard in St.&nbsp;Patrick’s Bay to Cape Beechey. I sent my photographic kit with instructions for him to leave it at Watercourse Bay.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Cross and I start for Watercourse Bay. We travel by the icefoot, finding the camera, etc. near the picturesque bergs referred to above. I exposed six plates on the best subjects and left the apparatus to be brought in by the returning party with the sledge. We come back overland getting into camp at 2 p.m.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="monday-26-1881">Monday 26, 1881</h2>
<p>I started this morning accompanied by Jens the Esquimaux with sledge and team of dogs ten to convey additional stores to depot “B” Cape Beechy. My load consisted of pemmican and extract of beef. I had much difficulty until passed Cape Murchison. I was compelled to unload the sled several times and carry it over rough places. Several of the dogs fell into the water. It is difficult to understand how a sled can be pulled through or over the rough ice front we traveled. Nothing but a Greenland sledge, lashed together with walrus hide could stand the terrible strain twisting we gave it; and no native power on earth other than a team of Eskimo dogs could have dragged it. I found excellent traveling from Cape Murchison to Beechy where I arrived at 3 p.m. After a jaunt of nine hours. I found Lt. Lockwood and party in camp occupying the tent that had been erected by Brainard and his party when the whaleboat was abandoned. As the tent was completely filled by the party, Jens and I were compelled to sleep outside the tent with no shelter. Of course we were in sleeping bags but the cold from the ground made our rest very uncomfortable. We gave the dogs a meal of pemmican before turning in. They kept up a continual wrangle all night — proving that they were not much fatigued. I therefore determined to make an early start to return during the night - -10 rather cold for sleeping out.</p>

<p>I started to return at 5:30 a.m. It was then threatening snow. Did not attempt to cook any breakfast as the party in the tent had not arisen. I therefore kept on until Cape Murchison was reached when I stopped about an hour making chocolate and warming feet. Found icefoot changed by tide around Distant Cape and was compelled to make new road. Arrived at home 1:30 p.m. Learned that the day before a large male wolf had been shot near our quarters. Although gaunt and thin it weighed 81lbs and was five foot from nose to tail. Lt. Kislingbury shot him. Wolf stood 33 1/2 inches hind quarters and 33 inches fore. Today Connell and a companion brought in another that had been poisoned. Lt. Lockwood returned at 8 p.m. He and party were well run down. It snowed slightly today.</p>

<p>Will the music never cease? The xylophone has experienced but little rest since it has been unpacked. Dr.&nbsp;Pavy prevented from starting by threatening storm. I however photographed the outfit, banners and bunting flying from both sledges. Connell after breakfast, and Lt. K after dinner started out after wolves. Both returned without success. The two natives astonished with an electric shock from the Chronograph. The “Regulars” happy, as the dead horse, in other words, the advance pay, worked off. Carpenters and tinsmith at work on the bathtub.</p>
<p>I developed the plates but find the dull weather and attempts to catch the ever moving dogs makes the negatives wanting in detail.</p>

<p>At 8:45a.m. Brainard, Bender and I started for the Bellows near the head of Discovery Harbor. We took with us the new Hudson Bay sledge just completed by Cross. We loaded it with tent, cooking utensils and provisions. I also took along camera and plates with the intention of getting if possible a view of “The Bellows”. The weight of our load was 143 lbs. We reached “The Bellows”, distant from camp 16 miles, at 3:40 p.m. A strong breeze was blowing and the temperature very cold. Before we could get tent pitched Brainard had his nose and one cheek frozen. Bender and I escaped from being frostbitten by rubbing the face almost continually. I set the minimum thermometer I brought along and at 7 p.m. it read -15. After preparing some chocolate over a spirit lamp we crawled into a sleeping bag. Spent a miserable night. Expected to find some rubber blankets supposed to be left at the Bellows by the party that had been there in September, but found they had been taken away, so nothing between the snowy ground and the sleeping bag. It was therefore extremely cold for that portion of our bodies nearest the ground.</p>

<p>Lt. Greely with Brainard and Bender started out to visit the United States Range of mountains. Connell was to accompany them one day’s march to assist in carrying the outfit, etc. Lt. Greely returns at 3 p.m. His knee goes out and Connell went on instead.</p>
<p>Henry and I set poisoned meat for the wolves in the valley near Mt. Cartnell. This is my first trip from camp since my return. The wolves have completely shredded the hides and cleaned the heads of the dead muskoxen.</p>

<p>The snow fell all day today. The commanding officer has given out that on the birthday of each member of the party a celebration of the event shall take place to such as the circumstances will permit. The member who’s birthday is celebrated shall on that day be exempt from all duty and shall have the privilege of making out the bill of fare for the dinner which will be the grand event of the day. In the evening a quart of rum is to be issued. Today is Whistlers birthday and he inaugurates the system.</p>

<p>Dr with Linn and Jewell attempt to carry rations to Cape to be cached there for the use of the party which is expected to go to Cape Joseph Henry later in the season. They get to Distant Cape when they find open water and the ice foot being rough and much obstructed, the Dr.&nbsp;decided to leave the rations there until later when the ice shall have formed. On the return of the party Lt. Greely decides to make an attempt himself as he considers the difficulty not sufficient to deter a party from getting around Distant Cape. He was over yesterday and examined the ground. Lt G. selects Brainard and I to assist him. We start at 1 p.m. with dogs and sledges. Frederick the Esquimaux is our driver. With great difficulty we succeeded in getting almost to Watercourse Bay when one sledge broke down and we were obliged to return.</p>

<p>This morning, the sledge having been repaired, Brainard, Linn and I start to complete the work commenced yesterday. Having noticed several floebergs that would make good subjects for pictures, I took my photographic apparatus along. Left it at Distant Cape as I did not wish to risk it on the other sledge over the rough icefoot. After assisting Brainard over the most difficult of the way, I left them at the entrance of Watercourse Bay, and returned for the photo outfit. By the time I again reached Watercourse Bay where the most striking bergs were, it had commenced snowing and I had succeeded in getting but indifferent light on the subjects. I exposed the plates and leaving the apparatus to be brought in by the sledge I returned to the quarters overland reaching camp at 6 p.m. On arriving I learned that the large hospital tent used as a carpenter’s shop had been burned down causing considerable excitement. At one time it threatened to communicate the flames to the house, our quarters as the tent was very near the latter. Ellison had his chest of carpenters tools and Biederbeck lost most of his underclothing which he had washed and left drying in the tent. Brainard and Linn returned at 8 p.m. They deposited the provisions on the north side of St.&nbsp;Patrick’s Bay.</p>

<p>This morning Lt. Kislingbury and I visit the musk ox offal to see if the poison we had laid for them had brought about any results. We found two victims stretched stark and stiff. They were both females with beautiful white coats. We carried them both to camp a difficult task as the distance was fully a mile. They weighed 57 and 61 pounds respectively. They appeared much larger than their weight indicates as they are very gaunt and thin. Their coats were beautiful, long white fur with a few black hairs along the back. They measured five feet from tip of tail to nose. I photographed one of them.</p>

<p>Started on our journey again 7 a.m. It is unnecessary to describe my suffering. Although the distance to St.&nbsp;Patrick’s Bay was short we were tramping until 10 p.m. before we reached the valley above the bay. I could hardly move. The Dr.&nbsp;preceded me as we neared the camping place and succeeded in finding water before I arrived. I laid down on the ground and he erected the camp over me. I could not move. He was compelled to leave me and start for camp.</p>

<p>The Dr.&nbsp;reached the station home at 3 a.m. and on reporting our condition a party made preparations to go to my assistance. Out of a large number of volunteers five were considered a sufficient number. They were preceded by Sgt.&nbsp;Brainard who reached me at 10 a.m. He brought with him a bottle of wine, warm rolls and soon prepared for me a good cup of chocolate. Although I had fasted so long I had no appetite. The wine however was very pleasant as I suffered much from thirst. At 12 p.m. the four men who followed Brainard arrived. They had brought a litter or ladder which served as one. I was placed on it and carried about four miles where the mountain afforded an easier ascent. The ascent was very steep and rough and an ineffectual attempt to carry me up decided Sgt.&nbsp;Brainard in sending for more help. Bender started for camp and five volunteers at once started. Meantime the first party were doing all they could for my comfort. An alcohol lamp was kept burning in the shelter tent which they had again erected over me again. Their own discomfort was considerable. The thermometer was below zero and they were compelled to walk to and fro to keep warm. The tent was too small to afford them shelter. I could not move hand or foot. At 8:30 p.m. the additional party arrived and with much difficulty they succeeded in carrying me up the hill where they placed me on a sledge and hauled me to the station where we arrived at 2 a.m. Sept 10th.</p>

<p>After being placed in bed this morning I began to improve. I had before leaving rested in sleeping bag in my tent but Gardiner had kindly arranged a cot for me in the quarters. The relief party who brought me in here, very much exhausted. Whistler (sic) had his foot frozen. I have learned that Lt. Lockwood found on arriving at station that his foot was badly frozen the day we met him as we started out Aug 29th.</p>

<p>I learn that during my absence ten, 10, muskoxen were killed at the “Bellows” about 13 miles from station. A sled and wagon abandoned by the English Expdn of ’75 were also found. Also the open water encouraged Lt. Greely to send party under Sgt.&nbsp;Brainard to Cape Beechy with whale boat to establish a depot of provisions to be used by sledge parties traveling north this fall. They encountered great difficulties. The moving ice continually threatened to crush the boat.</p>

<p>Sgt.&nbsp;Brainard’s party however, succeeded in reaching Cape Beechy after fifteen tiresome and dangerous hours at the oars. They found it impossible to return with the boat as the ice closed up the passage completely. They returned by land. They started from Station 31st August and returned Sept 3rd. Today Brainard and Cross make a trip to Hogback. They use snowshoes. I am improving rapidly</p>

<p>Dr.&nbsp;Pavy and Whistler with Eskimo Jens and two sledges and teams start out to examine Archers Fiord and English caches supposed to be in that direction. They had only proceeded a short distance on the ice when a pack of nineteen wolves were seen on the ice. Several nimrods attempted to get near enough for a shot but the wolves were too wary and left the ice, following the ravine to the northward. Whistler came back for a rifle and ammunition. The strong force of wolves rather alarmed the Dr.</p>

<p>The ravine at the foot at which we camped appeared to afford us a means of reaching the mountain top above and traveling overland to Wrangel Bay. Broke camp at 1:30 a.m. and made the difficult ascent to the top of the mountain. Our progress was slow and difficult. Aneroid Bar. indicated height of cliffs 2,500 feet. We found a strong breeze blowing with drifting snow. Our progress was now most difficult. The temperature was a few degrees below zero, the wind blew fiercely sending the blinding snow into our faces. Our breaths condensed and froze on our beards until the weight of the ice pulling the hair was painful. It was impossible to stop to eat or rest as no shelter was afforded. Reached Wrangel Bay at midnight and the first warm meal. We had traveled twelve hours and had eaten nothing but two biscuits each. We suffered very much of thirst and found that eating the frosty snow gave but little relief.</p>
<p>The pleasure it gave us to find water in our camp at Wrangel Bay can only be imagined. We had to cut through a foot of ice to reach it. Found traces of muskoxen at Wrangel Bay.</p>
</section>
<section id="friday-september-2-1881" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="friday-september-2-1881">Friday, September 2, 1881</h2>
<p>Left camp at 11:30 a.m. The temperature during the night was low. Our boots were frozen stiff and in placing a small canteen of rum to my lips it stuck instantly to them and in removing it the skin was taken off in places. Our socks generally got wet during the day and we would place one pair between our shirts at night where they were dry by the heat of the body. We now took to the icefoot and experienced much difficulty in places where the heavy ice has crowed and piled on the shore. I attempted to pass on new ice that had been formed during probably, our [] thaw two nights. I fell through in one place and got wet up to my waist. My boots were filled with water. I emptied them and rung the water out of my socks.” The boots retained so much of the water that I had wet feet all of the rest of the day. We reached Cape Frederick VII at 9 p.m. were forced to follow the shore of Lincoln Bay arrived to the north side where the depot of rations was placed. Through a mistake we pass them and finding ourselves out of the bay concluded to proceed a little further to Cape Union instead of doing so the following day as we had intended. The distance was greater than we supposed and by the time we were able to get back to Lincoln Bay after reaching Cape Union it was 10 a.m. on the 3rd. I was the first to find the depot and after a walk of 22 1/2 continuous hours with nothing to eat but a cup of chocolate and two biscuits, the cache of provisions was a pleasant sight.</p>
<p>We, notwithstanding our fatigue spent a few hours looking over the provisions. We went into camp at 1 p.m. of 3rd. We spent the day in examining the provisions, 1000 rations were left by the English and we found them after a lapse of six years in general good conditions. The bread was all spoiled as the barrels had shrunk and water had entered, but chocolate, preserved meat, stearine, etc. were as good apparently as when deposited. The barrel of rum was two thirds full. Some of the tobacco tea and sugar was injured, but the greatest part was still good.</p>
<p>I was extremely lame all day, my feet and joints of the legs swollen, but did not (know) the true cause of it until later. I suffered it the simple stiffness from the long walk and exposure, but the acute rheumatism had attacked me. I made every effort to overcome the difficulty as I attended to the stiffness induced by long traveling without rest but I found to be impossible, however, at 6 p.m. we started. Our progress was very slow as I suffered excruciatingly at every step. We had not traveled far before we met a large Arctic hare which I succeeded in shooting with the revolver I carried. It was a beautiful animal with its fur as white as snow, the tips of the ears black. The Dr., with a naturalist’s enthusiasm proceeded at once to add it to his load although I attempted to dissuade him on account of the already oppressive weight of our loads. I could not think of adding more to mine.</p>

<p>After leaving the depot at Lincoln Bay yesterday evening we crossed the bay, on reaching the other side the Dr.&nbsp;followed the icefoot while I kept out on the ice in bay. The Dr.&nbsp;had the best traveling and had to wait until I caught up to him. We then plotted along for sixteen hours reaching Wrangel Bay at 10 a.m. today. We pitched our tent and attempted to get water from the brook that supplied us when traveling the other way, but the frost had dried it up and we were compelled to melt snow. I cannot discuss my suffering in reaching this point. The acute rheumatism attacking my legs and arms made every step extremely painful to me. As the malady is always accompanied by fever I felt parched and thirst all the time, and water was a scarce as in the desert of the Sahara. I was cruelly disappointed several times after cutting 18 inches of ice to what I supposed was a pool of fresh water in the ice foot to find the water either salt or dried up.</p>
<p>At 6 p.m. we started again. I was so sick I had to be helped to my feet and could walk but slowly. The rheumatism had attacked my body so that breathing was difficult and painful. Reached Cape Beechey and camped at lakes 3 p.m. of 6th.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tuesday-september-6-1881">Tuesday September 6, 1881</h2>
<p>Started again at 9 p.m. I was suffering terribly. Dr.&nbsp;Pavy found my pulse up to 114. I desired that the Dr.&nbsp;to leave me and go on in advance so that I might rest my terribly swollen legs and follow him as soon as I could. He would not hear of such an arrangement. He then transferred almost all of my load to his pack leaving me only the tent to carry. After going a short distance he concluded to abandon the rabbit and other supplies articles such as cartridges, etc. Our progress was necessarily slow. The rheumatism in the muscle of the chest caused me to groan with every respiration. My limbs were terribly pained also —. Nothing but the greatest exercise of will enabled me to move at all. On several occasions thought of giving up let the consequences be what they might. We reached the small cache of provisions we had left in the ravine between Beechy and St.&nbsp;Patrick’s Bay at 9 a.m. on the 7th. We prepared a meal and quenched our thirst. Erected our shelter tent and attempted to rest but the pain racking my limbs made sleep impossible.</p>

<p>At 8 p.m. we attempted to start, but it was an impossibility with me. Dr.&nbsp;P tried to encourage me to get as far as St.&nbsp;Patrick’s Bay so that he could get from there to Station and send a party out for me. I was as sensible of the importance of proceeding as he was but for me to move was absolutely impossible. We made a compromise, however. I promised him to start the following morning. If it was still impossible he was to proceed to the home station and return with or send out party for me.</p>

<p>Light snow fell. The dogs are still dying off. Dr.&nbsp;Payve with the aid of Esquimaux Jens and Frederick is doing all that is possible to save them. Sulphur was administered. Dr.&nbsp;Myself and the Esquimaux made a second trip to Water Course Bay after the two carcasses of musk oxen. Took tent poles along and tied the meat up. Found the foxes had devoured some of the meat (see private journal this date)</p>

<p>Still busily engaged on the house. I am compelled to rest for a couple of days to recover from a strain I gave myself in the lifting the muskoxen at Water Course Bay.</p>

<p>Our house is so nearly completed that most of the party have deserted their tents and moved into the house. I still remain in the tent, as I anticipate that life in the house will be so monotonous during the long dark winter that the longer I camp out the better as the change will be more agreeable</p>

<p>My tentmates Jewell and Israel today transferred themselves to the house. I am left the sole occupant of the tent. I find it rather cool, but there is much comfort and pleasure in crawling into a warm deerskin sleeping bag. I find reading a pleasant occupation, although the conditions are entirely different from those under which this recreation is generally indulged in. After shooting myself as a sword into the fur scabbard of my sleeping bag, I draw the bag up under my chin and putting on cap and mittens enjoy myself with Dickens or the less enjoyable, but more instructive legal works of Kelent: A sense of comfort is experienced not withstanding the fact that the snow can be heard whirling against the canvas of the tent. And this is August. Today the “Proteus” heretofore unable to get away, succeeded in getting through the ice and passed out of sight. We cannot know of course what her success will be in getting out of Smith Sound until next year. Lt. Kislingbury on account of some dissatisfaction with the commanders management desired to go back. Permission was granted and he prepared to return by the Proteus, but before he could reach her, she passed out and he was compelled to remain.</p>

<p>A severe snow storm set in during last night, it snowed all day Friday. I spent most of the time in sleeping bag reading. The work on the house could only be carried on inside and afforded opportunities for but few of our number to work at the same time.</p>

<p>The Dr.&nbsp;and I were busy making preparations for a pedestrian trip to Lincoln Bay to examine the depot of provisions left by the English Expdn of ’75-76. We started at 7P.M. on our trip carrying a small tent, blankets, cooking apparatus alcohol and rations. Ralston and Linn accompanied us as far as St Patrick’s Bay at 1 a.m. on the 30th and camped all night. The weather was extremely cold. The thermometer was down to zero.</p>

<p>The fog was so dense in the morning that we did not attempt to travel as we were uncertain which of two routes to take and could not decide until a view was afforded.</p>
<p>The fog cleared up and we started from camp at 2 p.m. Traveled over very rough country and at 3 p.m. commenced descending the mountain side to the stream running into St.&nbsp;Patrick’s Bay, a most difficult task as the ground was rough and rocky and the decline very steep. Observed a strongly marked fog 4 p.m. It contained all the colors of the rainbow. We passed the stream at 6 p.m. and after ascending the hill on the other side we continued until we had traveled 10 hours, where we camp at 12 midnight in the neighborhood of Cape Beechy. We were compelled to sup on frozen preserve of meat and biscuit. With our alcohol lamp we melted enough snow to quench our thirst. The minimum thermometer registered +5 during the night.</p>

<p>We packed up, and made another start at 11:30a.m. We were compelled to make another difficult descent to the ravine at Cape Beechy. I saw numerous tracks of muskoxen and following them fell in with a herd of nine muskoxen. While the Dr. was engaged in making a cache of some of our rations for use on our return, I made a detour around one of the hills and attempted a shot at them with the large Colt revolver. I aimed but with without any result. They scampered off in a remarkably active manner considering their clumsy appearance. Their hair is very long and hangs from their belly nearly to the ground giving them an extemeley short legged appearance, but their agility can not be questioned as they will climb up the sides of an almost perpendicular cliff without difficulty. We render our way to the shore and attempted to reach Wrangel Bay by the ice foot. We only reached the “Blade Cliffs” where we found the ice foot completely washed away and the cliffs descending almost perpendicular to the water. It was impossible to span, or to climb up to the plateau or top of mountain. We were compelled to retrace out steps and camped at foot of ravine at 1:30 a.m. Sept 1st.</p>
