    "text": "What exactly is this project? It is a recreation of the diary of George W. Rice. George was the photographer of the expedition to Lady Franklin Bay in 1881, one of the expeditions for the First International Polar Year.\nThere have been books written about that expedition, and even a PBS special. That expedition, under the command of Lieut. Greely, only had 7 of the original 22 members return. George was one of the members who passed away before they were rescued. After the rescue, it appears that George’s diary was returned to his parents. The Berwick Register of Nova Scotia published extracts of his diary in the late 1800’s.\nIn addition, the diary, and his photographs became part of a collection for the Greely expedition that eventually ended up at Dartmouth College Library special collection.\nOutside of those who read the newspaper when these were originally published in the Berwick Register in the late 1800’s, the researchers who have accessed the diary, I’m guessing many people have not read any of it.\nGeorge W. Rice’s family in Berwick, Nova Scotia, Canada, are a far removed branch of my Grandfather’s, Robert (Bob) E. Rice, family. Bob’s nephew (name currently escaping me), was very interested in Rice family history, and obtained a copy of the diary newspaper clippings. My Grandfather Bob made three copies of the clippings, one for each of his children. When my mother passed from early onset Alzheimer’s, I was given her copy. As far as I am aware, not even many in my family have read much of them, as the copies were very disordered. This felt like a challenging puzzle to me when I first started looking at them, so I decided to see if I could get them in the right order. Over the course of a couple of weeks, I got them in order. But the copies are still really hard to read, and I think they deserve to be shared (and the copyright is long gone on them).\n\n\n\nA photo of one of the photocied pages\n\n\nWhen I contacted Dartmouth College Libraries about scans of the diary, I discovered that three individuals typed a transcript of the diary back in 2009 (thank you so much to Jim Lotz, KB Evans, and Suzanne Richardson). Dartmouth actually sent me photographs of the typed transcript! From the photographs, I can use some computer wizardry to extract the text from the images, with only correction needed on the badly warped pages where words get out of order. Which is much faster than typing up the newspaper extracts by hand.\nI’ll probably have another meta post about that process later, as well as where to get the original full set of computer extracts with the pages of the diary noted as well. The primary changes I’ve made are to remove the reference to the original diary page, and changed the date format.\nLet’s go along with George Rice, and the rest of the expedition to the then unknown northern reaches.\nThe first diary entry is here. You can use the side navigation to look for specific entries.\nOne note about the language and attitudes expressed in this work: George was living in the late 1800’s, and the writing reflects that, especially in his writing about the native peoples. I’m not editing anything out. I do encourage you to see those, be thankful how much some attitudes have changed, and perhaps also reflect on how much more change there needs to be."

She actually ran several feet up the side of the berg so great had been the momentum. She however, sustained no other injury than to destroy her head gear and neck off the (cutwater).

To a stranger from the south the weird appearance of these latitudes is most remarkable and fascinating — a dark, bold striking coastline beyond which the snow clad mountains ascending to dizzy altitudes can be seen as the gauzy curtain of the fog lifts. The sea dotted with bergs presents no other obstruction to the eye and as we again bring our eyes to land we are impressed with the silent and desolate appearance of land — no sign of animal or vegetable life disturbs or beautifies the scene. Silence reigns supreme.”",

The picturesque Esquimaux in their furry costumes were gliding over the water towards us in their graceful and fairylike kayaks, and the pantalooned maidens tripped down to the rocks to get a nearer view of us.

    "text": "Friday, September 2, 1881\nLeft camp at 11:30 a.m. The temperature during the night was low. Our boots were frozen stiff and in placing a small canteen of rum to my lips it stuck instantly to them and in removing it the skin was taken off in places. Our socks generally got wet during the day and we would place one pair between our shirts at night where they were dry by the heat of the body. We now took to the icefoot and experienced much difficulty in places where the heavy ice has crowed and piled on the shore. I attempted to pass on new ice that had been formed during probably, our [] thaw two nights. I fell through in one place and got wet up to my waist. My boots were filled with water. I emptied them and rung the water out of my socks.” The boots retained so much of the water that I had wet feet all of the rest of the day. We reached Cape Frederick VII at 9 p.m. were forced to follow the shore of Lincoln Bay arrived to the north side where the depot of rations was placed. Through a mistake we pass them and finding ourselves out of the bay concluded to proceed a little further to Cape Union instead of doing so the following day as we had intended. The distance was greater than we supposed and by the time we were able to get back to Lincoln Bay after reaching Cape Union it was 10 a.m. on the 3rd. I was the first to find the depot and after a walk of 22 1/2 continuous hours with nothing to eat but a cup of chocolate and two biscuits, the cache of provisions was a pleasant sight.\nWe, notwithstanding our fatigue spent a few hours looking over the provisions. We went into camp at 1 p.m. of 3rd. We spent the day in examining the provisions, 1000 rations were left by the English and we found them after a lapse of six years in general good conditions. The bread was all spoiled as the barrels had shrunk and water had entered, but chocolate, preserved meat, stearine, etc. were as good apparently as when deposited. The barrel of rum was two thirds full. Some of the tobacco tea and sugar was injured, but the greatest part was still good.\nI was extremely lame all day, my feet and joints of the legs swollen, but did not (know) the true cause of it until later. I suffered it the simple stiffness from the long walk and exposure, but the acute rheumatism had attacked me. I made every effort to overcome the difficulty as I attended to the stiffness induced by long traveling without rest but I found to be impossible, however, at 6 p.m. we started. Our progress was very slow as I suffered excruciatingly at every step. We had not traveled far before we met a large Arctic hare which I succeeded in shooting with the revolver I carried. It was a beautiful animal with its fur as white as snow, the tips of the ears black. The Dr., with a naturalist’s enthusiasm proceeded at once to add it to his load although I attempted to dissuade him on account of the already oppressive weight of our loads. I could not think of adding more to mine.",

The Dr. had the best traveling and had to wait until I caught up to him. We then plotted along for sixteen hours reaching Wrangel Bay at 10 a.m. today. We pitched our tent and attempted to get water from the brook that supplied us when traveling the other way, but the frost had dried it up and we were compelled to melt snow. I cannot discuss my suffering in reaching this point. The acute rheumatism attacking my legs and arms made every step extremely painful to me. As the malady is always accompanied by fever I felt parched and thirst all the time, and water was a scarce as in the desert of the Sahara. I was cruelly disappointed several times after cutting 18 inches of ice to what I supposed was a pool of fresh water in the ice foot to find the water either salt or dried up.\nAt 6 p.m. we started again. I was so sick I had to be helped to my feet and could walk but slowly. The rheumatism had attacked my body so that breathing was difficult and painful. Reached Cape Beechey and camped at lakes 3 p.m. of 6th.",

I desired that the Dr. to leave me and go on in advance so that I might rest my terribly swollen legs and follow him as soon as I could. He would not hear of such an arrangement. He then transferred almost all of my load to his pack leaving me only the tent to carry. After going a short distance he concluded to abandon the rabbit and other supplies articles such as cartridges, etc. Our progress was necessarily slow. The rheumatism in the muscle of the chest caused me to groan with every respiration. My limbs were terribly pained also —. Nothing but the greatest exercise of will enabled me to move at all. On several occasions thought of giving up let the consequences be what they might. We reached the small cache of provisions we had left in the ravine between Beechy and St. Patrick’s Bay at 9 a.m. on the 7th. We prepared a meal and quenched our thirst. Erected our shelter tent and attempted to rest but the pain racking my limbs made sleep impossible.",

Out of a large number of volunteers five were considered a sufficient number. They were preceded by Sgt. Brainard who reached me at 10 a.m. He brought with him a bottle of wine, warm rolls and soon prepared for me a good cup of chocolate. Although I had fasted so long I had no appetite. The wine however was very pleasant as I suffered much from thirst. At 12 p.m. the four men who followed Brainard arrived. They had brought a litter or ladder which served as one. I was placed on it and carried about four miles where the mountain afforded an easier ascent. The ascent was very steep and rough and an ineffectual attempt to carry me up decided Sgt. Brainard in sending for more help. Bender started for camp and five volunteers at once started. Meantime the first party were doing all they could for my comfort. An alcohol lamp was kept burning in the shelter tent which they had again erected over me again. Their own discomfort was considerable. The thermometer was below zero and they were compelled to walk to and fro to keep warm. The tent was too small to afford them shelter. I could not move hand or foot. At 8:30 p.m. the additional party arrived and with much difficulty they succeeded in carrying me up the hill where they placed me on a sledge and hauled me to the station where we arrived at 2 a.m. Sept 10th.",

Ovibus is estimated to be 2600 ft high. Our object was to reach the summit and examine with the telescope the valley leading from Muskox Bay to see if it offered a practical route to United States range of mountains. We were three hours in making the ascent from base at some places the climbing was most difficult and found a heavy deposit of snow at the top of the mountain. We were forced to use our snowshoes which we fortunately carried. It was my first attempt at walking with such foot gear, and I found I could travel comfortably. We did not accomplish anything as the atmosphere was hazy and could see no distance. Reached home at 5:30 p.m.\nLockwood and party returned at 7:45p.m. Linn got back at noon with the remainder of the Musk Ox meat from the Bellows.\nWeather fair- low temperature\nMaximum -11.\nMinimum -27.4\nThe above thermometer readings are for the 24 hours froml2 midnight to 12 midnight.

Lockwood, Gov. Elberg of U, Cross, Linn and myself) started this morning for Proven to procure two Esquimaux to accompany the expedition as dog drivers and hunters. The distance is about 50 miles. We took the inside passage through the islands as the sea was too rough to go outside. Our conveyance was the little steam launch “Lady Greely”. The scenery in the channels and fiords through which we passed was most remarkable and in the same grand and impressive scale as that of the Waigtt . Some of the passages were so narrow that at first sight it appeared impossible to get through them. But a nearer approach proved them to be as deep as mid ocean; the walls of the adamantine cliffs descend perpendicular to a great depth. Nothing but rock appears and that is evidently of volcanic formation. Occasionally a little carpeting of beautiful green moss covers the evidence of nature’s convulsions and is the only representative of the vegetable kingdom that we can see. We are at Proven at 9:30 p.m.",

    "text": "Wednesday, July 27, 1881\nAt Proven a better opportunity for studying the habits of the primitive aborigines, is afforded than at any other place we have visited. The whalers and the exploring parties seldom get there so the influence of the white man is less perceptible. They retain their habits of life as practiced before the white man improved their condition in other parts of Greenland. I spent at least three hours in one of the most uninviting (gloots?) or huts I saw. The manufacture of a cap of eider down for which I was waiting gave me a pretext for the long stay. The hut was built of (?) rocks and moss and was entered of a long tunnel so low that I was compelled to crawl on my hands and feet to affect an entrance, a most disagreeable and humiliating proceeding as the dogs and natives, not much better than the former in point of cleanliness, enter in the same way. On reaching the small interior hole, which is at once their living quarters, eating and sleeping room, I was surprised to see the mistress of the housed in a state of almost complete nudity sitting on the shelf or platform on which they sleep. I turned aside to give her an opportunity of donning more complete costume, but a furtive backward glance soon showed me that she appeared to prefer being dressed as nearly A la (?) as possible. I at once face the music and had some made a satisfactory arrangement by which I was to receive a ice cap in exchange for a neckerchief I wore. The former, however was not in issue so the contract remained executory (sic) until it was completed.\nThe maker measured the dome of my intended with great precision and was intensely employed in cutting up Eider skin and fitting them with a cap. Her scantiness of clothes appeared to give her an advantage as she seemed to get along more expeditiously by holding the skin between her feet while sewing.\nThe room was very low and the atmosphere stifling and nauseating from the odors exhaled by the skins and oil — no glass in the windows, as a substitute they used the membranous tissue of the stomach of the seal which when oiled is almost transparent. There was no stove or fireplace instead they used a hollow stone for a lamp with fuel oil and moss for a wick. The floor was of stone and earth. The sleeping arrangements were very simple, a platform about two feet high extending from the wall and occupies one side of the room. This is the receptacle of skins and (?) during the day and when the natives retire they make a (?) couch each disciple of morphea drawing over him or herself as many of the skins as necessary for comfort. The costume of the Esquimaux women is so nearly like that of the Inuit that at first sight is not easy to distinguish the (?) although the former make theirs up in a much more elaborate manner(—————–) Their feet are encased in a pair of dainty boots reaching - (?) at the knee, next came the pants or trunks which however are very short coming down, not more than half way of the thighs. The parts arte pulled up to meet them. The upper part of the body is covered by a cassock of sealskin devoid of buttons and pulled on over the head. An attached hood can be drawn over the head or allowed to fall back on the shoulders at pleasure. My cap being complete, I was glad to get away from the nauseating surroundings and into the fresh air again. Many of the natives from here occupy much better dwellings than the one I have described. - such as one represents the habitations of the poorer class who have not ….. with the Danes. In the (?) I entered a large building occupied by a half (missing sentence) need and finding an old violin on the wall I soon had a number of the fair sex dancing enthusiastically to my rather imperfect music. I became very popular with them at once and in leaving Proven which we did at 10:30 p.m. a bevy of dark maidens were at the shore to bid me ‘goodby’ or their Esquimaux equivalent. Through the efforts of Gov. Elberg the two Esquimaux, Christiansen and Edwards were induced to accompany us. They exhibited considerable emotion prying themselves away unlike their stoic North American relatives. On parting with their friends they shed bitter tears that fell indeed until their homes were out of sight.\nWe had a very pleasant passage returning. The Midnight Sun making it light as day. We shot 130 loons or at least we recorded that many. Large numbers remaining dead on the cliffs inaccessible to us. The females were sitting in rows incubating and when shot the eggs would roll off and come crashing down the rocks in thousands turning the water yellow. The two natives were in their element darting about in their graceful kayaks picking up the dead birds.",

Our departure from Upernavik furnished us with material for reflection. It is the last point at which the least semblance of civilization can be found — the course now leads into that vague unknown region which is so indefinitely marked out to be undefined. Our ship now ploughs waters that have seldom been disturbed. No sails whiten the broad expanse of dark blue water. In their stead the stately bergs stalk majestically along. We can scarcely refrain from descanting in the beauties of the latter whenever the subject is suggested. To think of them only as miniature islands of ice conveys no idea of their remarkable beauty — when lighted up by the peculiar rays of the midnight sun. I shall refer to them again later.",

A bear! was shouted in excited tones all over the ship and soon our hunters were seen emerging with their rifles. The bear a few hundred yards from the ship and among a number of shots fired, one or two bullets hit him. — up to this time he had been perfectly indifferent to our approach not finding it disagreeable for him. He went in to the water and swam a distance emerging to crawl in the ice again — by this time Kislingbury and Lockwood with Mr. Clay rowed nearer to him and soon dispatched him, bringing him triumphantly aboard. He was soon enthusiastically hoisted on board and as soon as he could be placed in position I proceeded to make a photograph of him. It was a young male in good condition. Our two Esquimaux were in their element dressing the carcass and soon had it hanging.",

The sun does not set until about 11p.m. and is up again at 1 a.m. The morning and evening twilight blend into one, casting a silver misty light over everything. I am writing this in the calm at midnight without the aid of artificial light. The crew has been busy all day shifting the cargo and putting more coals in the bunkers. Our men are bringing off the lumber that was left by the Gulnare. Also the pemmican stores etc. It has\nbeen too foggy for me to make photographs of Disco and the ship. On the day we arrived here we noticed a magnificent iceberg near the mouth of the harbor. It was in the form of an immense arch and presented a very impressive appearance. It was my intention to return and photograph it at the first opportunity but we had hardly reached our anchorage before it fell to pieces with a terrific crash louder than thunder. The sea was disturbed for miles.",

They were very much pleased to have the opportunity of being photographed and dressed themselves for the occasion with great care.” Miss Smith and her companion looked particularly charming in the bright lively colors of the Danish peasant girl.\nAt least they look very charming to someone who does not expect to see another female in a civilized costume for two years —\nLt. Greely purchased a quantity of whale skin for food — it is said to be an excellent anti-scorbutic and is said to resemble tripe in flavor. It is in a dried state.\nHe also has contracted for dried fish and walrus meat which is to be the food of the dogs. We will take in about 14 dogs here and will get others at Rittenbank and at Upernavik. Inspector Smith and Capt. Fleisher are aiding our commander in every possible way.",

The latter is most disagreeable in odor as it is partly decomposed. But appears to be relished well by the dogs. Getting the animals on board was a very exciting operation. They offered every resistance and yelped in a most discordant and disagreeable manner. They are now penned in a small space on deck where they snarl and snap at one another in the most unfriendly way. Several encounters between the most warlike of the males has settled the question of supremacy and now one battle scarred old veteran struts about master of the situation.\nWe are Ready to start but the fog is too dense to admit of going.

The frowning cliffs rise abruptly from the sea which calmed by the numerous icebergs is as placid as the waters of Central Park and reflects back the cliffs and the snow clad mountains behind them. The stately bergs present the most beautiful feature of the panorama. Immense islands of ice pure and white as Parian marble awaiting the sculptors chisel although no artist could give them more beautiful and fantastic forms resembling at times the mosques and minarets of some oriental city as the midnight sun dyes them with glorious tints. The base is generally marked with a beautiful green where the dark blue water washes over it.",

I find it rather cool, but there is much comfort and pleasure in crawling into a warm deerskin sleeping bag. I find reading a pleasant occupation, although the conditions are entirely different from those under which this recreation is generally indulged in. After shooting myself as a sword into the fur scabbard of my sleeping bag, I draw the bag up under my chin and putting on cap and mittens enjoy myself with Dickens or the less enjoyable, but more instructive legal works of Kelent: A sense of comfort is experienced not withstanding the fact that the snow can be heard whirling against the canvas of the tent. And this is August. Today the “Proteus” heretofore unable to get away, succeeded in getting through the ice and passed out of sight. We cannot know of course what her success will be in getting out of Smith Sound until next year. Lt. Kislingbury on account of some dissatisfaction with the commanders management desired to go back. Permission was granted and he prepared to return by the Proteus, but before he could reach her, she passed out and he was compelled to remain.",

I saw numerous tracks of muskoxen and following them fell in with a herd of nine muskoxen. While the Dr. was engaged in making a cache of some of our rations for use on our return, I made a detour around one of the hills and attempted a shot at them with the large Colt revolver. I aimed but with without any result. They scampered off in a remarkably active manner considering their clumsy appearance. Their hair is very long and hangs from their belly nearly to the ground giving them an extemeley short legged appearance, but their agility can not be questioned as they will climb up the sides of an almost perpendicular cliff without difficulty. We render our way to the shore and attempted to reach Wrangel Bay by the ice foot. We only reached the “Blade Cliffs” where we found the ice foot completely washed away and the cliffs descending almost perpendicular to the water. It was impossible to span, or to climb up to the plateau or top of mountain. We were compelled to retrace out steps and camped at foot of ravine at 1:30 a.m. Sept 1st.",

After assisting Brainard over the most difficult of the way, I left them at the entrance of Watercourse Bay, and returned for the photo outfit. By the time I again reached Watercourse Bay where the most striking bergs were, it had commenced snowing and I had succeeded in getting but indifferent light on the subjects. I exposed the plates and leaving the apparatus to be brought in by the sledge I returned to the quarters overland reaching camp at 6 p.m. On arriving I learned that the large hospital tent used as a carpenter’s shop had been burned down causing considerable excitement. At one time it threatened to communicate the flames to the house, our quarters as the tent was very near the latter. Ellison had his chest of carpenters tools and Biederbeck lost most of his underclothing which he had washed and left drying in the tent. Brainard and Linn returned at 8 p.m. They deposited the provisions on the north side of St. Patrick’s Bay.",

My load consisted of pemmican and extract of beef. I had much difficulty until passed Cape Murchison. I was compelled to unload the sled several times and carry it over rough places. Several of the dogs fell into the water. It is difficult to understand how a sled can be pulled through or over the rough ice front we traveled. Nothing but a Greenland sledge, lashed together with walrus hide could stand the terrible strain twisting we gave it; and no native power on earth other than a team of Eskimo dogs could have dragged it. I found excellent traveling from Cape Murchison to Beechy where I arrived at 3 p.m. After a jaunt of nine hours. I found Lt. Lockwood and party in camp occupying the tent that had been erected by Brainard and his party when the whaleboat was abandoned. As the tent was completely filled by the party, Jens and I were compelled to sleep outside the tent with no shelter. Of course we were in sleeping bags but the cold from the ground made our rest very uncomfortable. We gave the dogs a meal of pemmican before turning in. They kept up a continual wrangle all night — proving that they were not much fatigued. I therefore determined to make an early start to return during the night - -10 rather cold for sleeping out.",

I also took along camera and plates with the intention of getting if possible a view of “The Bellows”. The weight of our load was 143 lbs. We reached “The Bellows”, distant from camp 16 miles, at 3:40 p.m. A strong breeze was blowing and the temperature very cold. Before we could get tent pitched Brainard had his nose and one cheek frozen. Bender and I escaped from being frostbitten by rubbing the face almost continually. I set the minimum thermometer I brought along and at 7 p.m. it read -15. After preparing some chocolate over a spirit lamp we crawled into a sleeping bag. Spent a miserable night. Expected to find some rubber blankets supposed to be left at the Bellows by the party that had been there in September, but found they had been taken away, so nothing between the snowy ground and the sleeping bag. It was therefore extremely cold for that portion of our bodies nearest the ground.",

Cape Alexander in Lat 78° 10’N and is considered the key to the unknown Arctic. Considerable exultation was felt.\n“We are within 8 degrees of the Pole”, says Lt. Greely — If we never get any nearer.” We soon passed Port Foulke — Dr. Hayes winter quarters and anchored about near by Lyttleton (sic) Island. Capt Allen Young in the ‘Pandora’ left letters here for the Alert and Discovery which were never recovered by the latter ships as they were on their way home and were south of this place when Capt Young departed. It was also about this place that the ill starred Polaris was lost and on the mainland the party under Captain Buddington mutinied — so we had abundant interest in going ashore here. One party under Lt.Greely went to Cove for the bag of letters and another with Lt. Kislingbury to find the Polaris quarters — or what remained — to the latter I attached myself taking my photographic apparatus along — after a row of about 2 miles we entered Lifeboat Cove and after tramping around discovered a demolished cairn, probably by the Indians, and broken scientific instrument including a transit, strewn about. Further on we found remains of their quarters — stoves, nails, locks, instruments, etc. etc. The time passed very quickly as we handled and looked over the articles so unceremoniously left behind when the Ravenscraig brought the storm tossed party such a happy delivery. I photographed the site and also made a few of Lifeboat Cove. An adventure awaited us on our return. While paddling across Lifeboat Cove a school of walruses were seen disporting themselves in the water. We cautiously approached them and soon a well directed bullet was lodged in the neck of a large female. The herd deserted her and her calf emitting the most piteous sound was seen crawling on the neck of the mother. The water was dyed with blood. Clay succeeded in hitting the calf and no doubt killed it — as it sank at once an did not rise again. The mother dove but soon came up again and again struck. She now came directly for the boat. With evident warlike intentions. Waiting until she was within twenty feet of the boat Lt. K and Clay fired simultaneously, the two bullets rattling in her open mouth down her throat. We waited for her to rise again but nothing more was seen of her. I have no doubt that both the mother and the calf were killed as they always sink when shot. A harpoon is required to save them.\nWe found Lt. Greely and his party on shore. They shortly after came in loaded with kegs and boxes of letters and pemmican that had been left for the Nares party. Lt. G. will send then by the to go to England via Newfoundland.",

The experience of all who passed up Smith Sound has been that the passage is difficult to make and nothing but the most untiring and energetic warfare with the ice will enable any ship to pass and then only when the season is favorable. Our experience is without precedent and cannot be accounted for. Passed Cape Constitution, mountains highest and now at 9:40 p.m. after several delays on account of fog and detours to avoid ice we meet the main pack — solid and forbidding — The ice appears solid and densely packed, no channels or openings with Capes Lieber and Baird on the side and Thank God Harbor and the celebrated Petermann Fiord on the other, only 10 miles from our destination. We are as completely cut off from it as if this ice had met us at a lower latitude. After steaming around to see if any opening presented the ice, anchors were brought out and the old Proteus made fast to the ice to await further developments.

Each successive charge sending her farther into the harbor. As the question of our establishing our quarters here or nearer the cole-mine four miles distant was not settled, the ship was allowed to remain quiet until a visit to the coal mine and a knowledge of our prospects should decide the matter.

On the eve of the 18th Proteus ready to start as all cargo was discharged, but the weather being bad, Capt. Pike decided to remain at anchor until 4 a.m. The majority of party transferred their chattels ashore and erected tents. I remained on board finishing letters and did not leave the ship until she was underway.\nDuring the past week I have been making photographs daily at our camp as it increased in size and the house as it assumed from day to day the appearance of a human habitation. The negatives are sent to the Signals Office and will serve to show the progress we are making and also the general appearance of the locality. I was kept excessively engaged writing my letters up to that time and snatching a few hours sleep before breakfast. Many letters to write as no other opportunity may be offered for years. At least one year, and the experience of this season rather shakes my belief in the ability of a ship to reach this latitude every season. It is a mere chance. I made most of the negative at midnight, writing my letters up to that time and snatching a few hours of sleep before breakfast. The working party has been divided into two groups — one working while the other slept. In this way the work was going on all the time. Of course night offered no disadvantages; the sun was above the horizon during the twenty four hours. I was able to make photographs at any hour of the night.\nOn the morning of the 19th, 4 a.m. after finishing my letters and making out dispatch for New York Herald, I went ashore. It was snowing hard. Borrowed a sleeping bag from Dr. Pavy, and finding that Jewell and Israel occupied a larger tent than was necessary for their accommodation I was soon comfortably ensconced inside their tent.\nThe Proteus did not succeed in getting very far, just outside the breakwater at Bellot Island. The ice had packed in as firmly to admit of their passing.\nOn 21st Ryan was taken with an epileptic fit and it was decided to send him home - this makes the second man sent back for physical disability. Starr, the other man, showed asthmatic tendencies.",

The load on sledge, an English one formed here, weighed 1,100 — a heavy drag through the snow and over the icefoot.\nI followed at 9:30 with dog sledge and Jens the Esquimaux. The plan is that I am to support Lt. Lockwood, aiding him with the dog team until the arrival of Dr. Pavy when I join him for a trip to Wrangle Bay to carry rations for the spring trip. My team was composed of but 7 dogs as two of the bitches had newly born litters and not the same number of serviceable dogs, 7, were left for the Dr. The load of 600 lbs that we had on the sled was therefore too heavy. I met with the Dr. and Lt. Kislingbury near Dutch Island and arranged with him to leave one bag of bread at Murchisons to be brought on by his team as he expected to have a light load. Overtook the party of Lt. Lockwood at Murchison at 2 p.m. They were plodding along steadily and expected to reach Beechy by night. I furnished them with a drink of chocolate I had brought warm in our sleeping bag and proceeding on advance. I reached Cape Beechy at 7 p.m. and Lt. L and party at 8 p.m. We occupied the snowhouse erected some time ago and were very comfortable I brought but one sleeping bag as it reduced the weight on the sled and Jens the Eskimo and I occupied it.",

Temperatures during the night -17.\nLt. Lockwood started out with Jens and the dogs for Cape Murchison to bring two bags of coal. He also intended to examine the small boat left in St. Patrick’s Bay by the English in 1875. I, assisted by Ellis, put out rations and built a snow pedestal for a telescope we had brought. Brainard with rest of party started back for remainder of their load abandoned the night before. Brainard and party returns at 1:30 p.m. Lt. K returns at 4 p.m. He forgot to bring sack of pemmican which was to be part of his load. Mock moons observed at 8 p.m. Temperature -11.",

    "text": "November 5th 188]\nI observed an amusing tableau last night before retiring. The snow house not being large enough to accommodate us all, Ellis Saler and Biederbeck pitched a tent outside and occupied a sleeping bag large enough to hold three men. Ellis and Saler retired and left the candle burning for Biederbeck who was making preparations for cooking breakfast in the morning. I happen to look in the tent and was almost convulsed with laughter to see “Old Mate”, one of the most disagreeable and mangy looking of all the dogs, occupying the middle place in the sleeping bag left vacant for B. He was lying on his side head on the pillow with one paw thrown lovingly over Ellis’ neck. As I laughed he looked up and expression said as plainly as I can interpret it: “It is all right. I am one of them.” At 9:30 Dr. Pavy and I started for Wrangle Bay. Lt. Kislingbury accompanied him with one sledge and team and Jens and I had the other one.\nWhen we left Lt. Lockwood and party were making preparations for crossing the Strait. They are repairing the boat I had brought from Murchison\nWe proceeded for a short distance when Jens told me that the little bitch “Gypsy” exhibited symptoms of matemity. He tried to drive her back thinking she would return to the snow house but she returned to the team. We then proceeded with her. She soon became tired an ill and we carried her on the sledge. This reduced our teams to six dogs each as three bitches were left at the home station with litters. We had a difficult time traveling over much ground which was also icy. Camped at 7:15 p.m. in the valley.",

After breakfast Jens and I built a small snow house and placed the mother with the pups in it. I left some pemmican so that she would not starve during our absence. We then broke camp and deserted her. 9:30 am. We traveled all day and had a most interesting journey. We found the traveling very good. At about noon we entered the lower ravine leading in a more easterly direction towards Wrangle Bay.\n(Drs’ sled) was on a much lower level than the one we were on and we made a most exciting descent into it. Finding our efforts to hold the sledge back to no avail I threw myself on the sledge. Jens dragged by the standards behind. The dogs started on the full run and would not be controlled; the sledge however descended faster than they and running away some rocks the lines became entangled and the sledge stopped. Found good traveling in the lower valley and reached our destination Wrangle Bay at 2:30 p.m. It was then beginning to snow.",

The one caught fire but was smothered before any damage done. About 4 p.m. Ellison was in the carpenter tent and attempted the experiment of filling a gasoline lamp without extinguishing it. He made a very successful failure, but will not likely again try it. In an instant he was enveloped in flames the whole can of fluid igniting.

    "text": "Thursday, November 24th 1881\nThe day clear and favorable for the sports to be engaged in. Of course the drawbacks of darkness and cold must be taken into consideration. We are unfortunately in the dark period of the moon the presence of which would supply us with all the light we would require. Thermometer over 60 below the freezing point making this doubtless the coldest Thanksgiving day that has ever been celebrated.\nAt an early hour the men were all engaged in perfecting their arrangements for the different races; the cooks preparing their (hands?) and even the dogs making noisy demonstrations as if to show that they too entered into the spirit of the day.\nAfter breakfast the first thing on the programme was the snowshoe race. It was called for 10 am: but for an hour before that time the clattering of the shoes could be heard through the quarters as the men tested the security of the fastenings. We all repaired to the course on the ice in harbor which was staked out and very imperfectly lighted. The distance was 200 yds and return. Eight competitors entered and a good start was effected. And now the affair became most amusing to the bystanders. Many of the men were not familiar with the cumbersome footgear and this added to the difficulty of finding the way over the ill light course, made their progress most awkward and erratic. The “Montreal Snowshoe Club” would have considered it a strange exhibition. An unperceived piece of ice would trip some luckless fellow up and away he would go floundering in the snow to serve as a footmat for his impetuous rivals who were following him with more haste than speed.\nAs soon as the unfortunate could recover his 2 x 4 feet he would probably be run into by some fleet footed Mercury who could not distinguish him from the surrounding snow in which he had been wallowing. Many were the mishaps before the goal was reached.\nSgts. Brainard, Ralston, Gardiner came in and won the first three prizes. They reached the home stake in the order in which they are named.\nPrizes were: 1st Bot of pres. Peaches: 1 gill rum, (towel) and soap. 2nd 1 gill rum, towel and soap\nWe then repaired to the quarters where bets were settled and paid and other wagers laid on the result of the approaching running race. I found myself the winner of a large amount of tobacco (our legal tender) having backed Brainard against Gardiner, who was the favorite.\nI acted as stakeholder for the party and in that capacity handed over a large amount of tobacco to the lucky gamblers.\nThe running race footrace now came up and after a tie between three of the six contestants it was soon over and the first place won by Ellis, Henry second and Linn third. Prizes; 1st 1 pt. rum, towel and soap, 2nd 1 gill rum and towel, 3rd 1/2 gill and soap.\nThe rifle shooting came last and most of the party engaged in it. Henry won the first prize (bot of pres. peaches, 1/2 pt rum and soap), Jens 2nd (1 gill rum, towel and soap) and Cross 3rd 1/2 gill rum and soap. (over) We were much interested in the result of the dog driving match between the two Esquimaux. They were made to understand it perfectly i.e. the arrangement, and set about harnessing up the dogs. While they were doing so we went inside the quarters expecting to be notified when they were in readiness so that we might see and regulate the start. However the canine Jehus took the matter in their own hands. We discovered they had gone and patiently awaited their return. They came in shortly at a terrific pace Frederick ahead thus winning the pipe and half pound of tobacco constituting the prize.\nThree auroral streamers were observed.\nWe were now ready for dinner which was served at 4 o’clock. I give here the bill of fare which considering our distance from market was varied and palatable.\nOur chef de cuisine excelled himself:\n(Oyster soup, crabs, lobster salad, Eider Ducks, boiled ham, green corn, lima beans, asparagus, jelly cake, fruit and sponge cakes, Peach pie, blueberry pie, vanilla ice cream, coffee, warm biscuit, nuts figs etc.) After dinner grog was issued larger quantity than usual and songs were in order.\nLt. Greely having appointed me distributor of the prizes I attached the said role of each of the party and succeeded in getting up a most ridiculous dress suit for the occasion: an old long tailed coat of Jewell’s was transformed by the use of shears into a swallow tail of remarkable pattern, a dilapidated white vest, immense collar, profuse jewelry manufactured by the tinsmith, and an immense pair of Esquimaux boots completed the costume. Lt. Greely made us a short address after which I conferred the prizes.",

Henry’s department was the personal column and some of his lists although perfectly harmless gave great offense to those who were alluded to. The bully Whistler as usual made a complete ass of himself. Frederick also considered himself greatly aggrieved. Although contributions had been solicited there was no response except from Lt. Greely who sent in a short letter over “Occasional.” For my part of the sheet see “Arctic Moon” of date Nov 24” editorial Arctic Moon account of Lt.

He started with two or three companions to walk to Dutch Island, which by the way, is the objective point of all pedestrians, the intervening path being well beaten, and was not aware that the two Eskimos had preceded him. It is very dark now and they had proceeded but half way when by the dim light they saw what they supposed to be a pack of ravenous wolves emerging from the ice hummocks and making for them. They were unarmed but Brainard with great coolness told his companions to get their knives in readiness and prepared to repel the onslaught of the ferocious beasts. Hastily opening their knives some of them insignificant pen knives they stood in an agony of suspense until the near approach of the animals proved them to be dogs that had accompanied the Eskimos and had started on in advance to meet the new party with demonstrations of delight and no belligerent intention whatever.",

Nothing, however, can overcome their propensities for fighting. During the couple of hours I was engaged with them I noticed nine different encounters which were usually general, no non-combatants to be seen.\nThey have divided into two parties and it does not appear possible to associate one party with the other. I was only using one team and the other apparently jealous of the preference shown the first barred the road at every point where it was possible and contended the passage of the loaded sledge. I was compelled to precede the team and drive them off. Lunar halo and mock moons were seen at 3:30 p.m. They presented a beautiful appearance.",

    "text": "Tuesday Dec 13th 1881\nToday Jens the Esquimaux concluded he would vary the monotony of our life by absconding. His elopement was discovered at breakfast time. He had been seen in the early morning however and we naturally concluded that he had not traveled far. After breakfast Lt. Greely instructed Brainard and I to start from a point outside the Station and by walking in opposite directions discovered (Jens) tracks leading from the Station.\nIt was about 8:30 a.m. when we started. Henry volunteered to go with me and Whistler went with Brainard. It was very dark, the sky overcast and no moon in the heavens. Fortunately for Jens light snow had fallen the day previous so that his tracks could be easily found and distinguished from others. I soon found his tracks following the beaten track towards Dutch Island. We communicated with Brainard and Whistler who soon found us and we proceeded at a rapid rate expecting to overtake the fugitive in a short time as the track looked fresh and we knew that he had been very long on the road. After proceeding a short distance we thought it best to send back word to the Station to follow us with a dog team in case Jens should lead us a long chase. Henry and Frederick the other Esquimaux returned.\nBrainard Whistler and I followed the trail expecting to catch up to Jens at any moment for we could see unaided by any lights he had not been able to follow the path directly but wavered on and off. With our lanterns we moved on very rapidly until Dutch Island distant two miles was reached. Beyond that point the path is not well defined as it has not been traveled since the last party came in from Cape Beechy. We saw that our game had turned off at right angles towards the ice foot so as to follow the coastline and avoid being lost in the ice. His track now became difficult to follow much time being lost in keeping (?) of them. When about five miles from the home we were joined by Dr. Pavy with Frederick and dog team. We kept on at the most rapid rate practicable, two of us going in advance with the lantern, the others following the track as we found it. The ice foot was very rough and the darkness was so intense that it was impossible to select the most favorable route for the sledge even if the erratic course taken by Jens allowed for it. When near Distant Cape the progress was very slow and at one place I dropped behind to allow the Dr. a better position behind the sledge. We had been walking behind it intending to join him as soon as the point was passed. I had just left the advance and being able to hold on to the standards of the sledge and depend upon it for guidance. I blew out the candle in my lantern to economize our light. As soon as I dropped behind, the sledge disappeared in the dark and in groping my way after it I met with several severe falls. I did not go far before I slipped and was thrown violently against a projecting piece of ice. It was several minutes before I could move from my prone position on the ice, when I discovered that my shoulder was undoubtedly broken. I regained my footing and appreciating the importance of catching up with the sledge, I lit my candle under great difficulty presented by the wind and the use of one hand only. I started at the best gait I could suffering intensely and encountered several more falls in one of which my light went out and delayed me. I expected the sledge to wait for me at the moment they discovered my absence. It appeared they were so interested in the chase that my absence was not noticed or they thought I was following at my leisure. I plotted along my candle burnt out. I overtook the party at a point a little south of Cape Murchison distant about ten miles to reach while our (treacherous) way traveled much farther. They had just concluded to wait for me. On learning (of) my condition Whistler started to return with me.\nBrainard and the Dr. continuing in the way intending to go as far as Cape Beechy and spending the night at the snowhouse if they did not find Jens. Whistler and I made but slow progress on the return as 1 was compelled to avoid jarring my shoulder. When near Distant Cape Whistler began to complain of the cold, a few moments after he began to talk incoherently and before a mere halfway to Dutch Island he was delirious. My position was becoming rather unpleasant. Whistler overcome by the cold, was entirely unresponsive and it took all my will and ingenuity to induce him to walk. He was continually falling down and could hardly resist the temptation to remain on the ice. I attempted to lead him and having no light our footing was so uncertain that I was continually jarred by missteps which caused me to suffer intensely from my shoulder. I had to cajole, coax and command Whistler at every step to get him along. I began to fear for his life: had he refused to move he might have died in a very few moments.\nWe got as far as Dutch Island when Dr. Pavy, Brainard and the Esquimaux overtook us with the dog sledge. I at once gave the Dr. the state of affairs and told him it was necessary to get Whistler to the Station as soon as possible. It was necessary to make him run behind the sledge and we learned on reaching the Station that when near the Station they had to place him on the sledge as he had lost all use of his limbs.\nBrainard and I reached the Station at 4 p.m.\nWe had been out about 8 hours, traveled at least twenty miles with the temperature at -30 on one of the darkest days of the winter. Whistler was delirious for several hours, his nose and cheeks frozen but otherwise he suffered no bad consequences. Dr. examined my shoulder and found fracture not complete but the bone evidently cracked and ligature injured. Jens was overtaken a short distance beyond the point from which we started to return. He came back quite penitently but did not attempt to explain the cause of his strange conduct. Light snow was falling almost all day.",

Greely requested me to try and arrange some sort of entertainment as a diversion for the party the time hanging heavily on our hands at present. I found it impossible to carry out any such plan successfully as our party is so small that after making a cast of performers there would be but a small audience remaining. Then it would be impossible to rehearse or arrange anything except in the presence of the others so by the time of the performance the programme would be stale and uninteresting. I therefore gave up the idea but suggested to the men that we should invite Lt. Greely to lecture before us. They were pleased with the suggestions and I made our wishes known to Lt. Greely. He kindly assisted and tonight favored us with some interesting remarks on the Polar question: a subject absorbing to us at present. An Aurora observed at 8p.m.",

    "text": "Monday January 16th 1882\nToday we experienced the most severe storm I have ever witnessed. Barometer began to fall a little after midnight, 15th, a light breeze setting in from the west at that time. Sky clouded up at this time a small space at the zenith only being partly clear so that a few stars could be seen shining through. Barometer showing more decided fall as the morning advanced. At 8 a.m. slight fall of snow began wind sprang up from SW, blowing 4 miles an hour. The remarkable fall of barometer induced Lt. Greely to have it observed every 15 minutes. About now the expected storm came in full force, Ralston who was on duty found great difficulty in reaching the instrument shelter when the violence of the wind blew out his candle. He returned and Jewell accompanied him. They succeeded in reading the thermometer of -12° 5 a remarkable rise of 17 ° 8 since 7 a.m. Brainard read the tide gauge. By the time 1 o’clock came round the storm had so increased in violence that although several relays and relief parties attempted to reach the instrument shelter none were successful. Connell and] started for the tide gauge but had not struggled through the blinding drift before our lantern was extinguished and we were compelled to return to the Station. I cannot describe the fury of the storm. It was intensely dark, the wind was howling out of the N.E. at the rate of 60 miles an hour carrying with it clouds of frozen snow that cut the face like powdered glass or sparks of fire. The resistance to the body was tremendous, it was impossible to move in an upright position. We lost the path and tumbled over the hill to the ice foot making no attempt to save ourselves. On returning two volunteers joined us and we started again with a red signal lamp. It was Brainard and Biederbeck who accompanied us, their success at 12 o’clock causing them to (?) our attempt. We all stumbled precariously over the bank but could not find the path. We crawled along a short distance when someone behind me said “Let’s try and get back.” Biederbeck’s red light showed up a little in advance however and we followed it and succeeded by mere chance in reaching the snow house over the tide gauge. Our return was not quite so difficult but we had hard work and returned to the quarters bruised and almost frozen. Our faces were covered with a sheet of ice. Observations were now discontinued at the shelter and a thermometer was exposed at the side of our building near the door. At 2:30 p.m. the anemometer cups were blown away. Several tents were blown down and other damage done. The highest velocity recorded before the anemometer blew away was 65 miles but there is not doubt it increased afterwards and we are inclined to think 80 miles per hour not too high an estimate. It was during a lull just before 12 o’clock that the winds shifted around to N.E. where it remained during the remainder of the storm. It ceased to blow with great violence after 4 o’clock but a stiff breeze was felt all day as soon as the observation at the instrument shelter and the tidal gauge resumed. Life lines were placed for the guidance of the observer.\nTemp -11° .0 to -31°.1 obs. and corrected",

It is however difficult to keep from reading during these cold dark days when there is little else to do. I presume I have read at least six hours per day all winter.",

    "text": "Monday February 20th 1882\nA very cool morning. The light is increasing so that I thought I would try my luck with a shotgun today. Whistler and I started for Watercourse Bay. In the ravine leading to the coal mine we startled up a fine large hare which I followed for miles, succeeded in getting within about 75 yards of him and risked a shot but without effect. The strangest part of the affair was the manner in which the little animal traveled: he stood perfectly upright, kangaroo like, and hopping on his hind legs made enormous strides. Not until he started to ascend the side of the ravine did he assume his proper position of a quadruped.\nWe passed some time at the grotto mentioned by Mr. Hodson in his interesting article that appeared in the “Frasier’s” after the return of the British expd’n in 1876. It came fully up to our expectations.\nOn our return we again startled our hare and I persistently followed it by the failing light until it disappeared entirely. It began to snow slightly as we came through the gap and it was difficult to prevent faces from freezing. Whistler’s face was frozen repeatedly and it took some time to remove the frost—J. R. Lt G —see private journal—\nMy eyes still trouble me.",
