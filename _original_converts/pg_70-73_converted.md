I hauled my quota of ice. The quarters have become a perfect Babel or worse.
The tinner, carpenter, tentmaker and shoemaker are all busily engaged at their several
callings preparing the foot gear, sledges, lamps and other paraphernalia for the
eagerly-looked-forward to spring explorations.



## Friday February 24th 1882

Linn, Connell and Biederbeck went to the coal mines to mine some coals. I
went along with gun hoping to get a shot at my hare. The caracaturist of our party has
embellished the wall with a drawing representing my surprise at seeing the
“kangaroo.”

I was gone five hours and saw nothing in the way of game. I succeeded however, in
freezing my cheeks and nose. The weather is slightly warmer.


## Saturday February 25th 1882

Hauled ice. Took a walk with Dr — see P J

Several parties were out hunting as the light has now become so bright as to make it
safe and pleasant. The quarters still present the appearance of a machine shop. A boat
which Cross is painting bas been added to the stock. The temperature has taken a
remarkable rise.

## Sunday February 26, 1882

A quiet Sabbath. The light has increased so that today the idea of beholding
ourselves by natural instead of artificial light occurred to some of us. We were all
perplexed at the bleached out appearance of our countenances.

I was much amused at the consternation of the old “Kingatoon” — our boss
dog — when I showed him his “counterfeit presentment” in a mirror: he showed fight
at once. I took a walk with Schneider and the pups.

Jewell with driver and dog team made a trip to Murchison and back taking
some stores.

A very quiet evening after the rum passed around.

I indulge in some reflections of a sentimental, slushy nature — see private journal.



## Monday February 27th 1882

Henry’s birthday; a good bill of fare. Lt. Greely tells me to prepare for taking
observations.

Ralston and Schneider go to Bellot Island to read the meteorological
instruments.

They see a hare. I go on duty at midnight.

## Tuesday February 28th 1882

The sky this morning was of a most beautiful rose color, predicting the
appearance of the sun which showed its upper limit at 11.40 a.m. The whole disk was
seen from 11:45 to 11:57

Gardiner, Connell and I — just coming off observations miss seeing the
returning luminary. The prodigal sun was just seen by Dr. Pavy. Ralston and Henry
who met him at the top of Cairn Hill before he lighted up our somber dwelling. I
believe it is the rule to indulge in some attempt at poetical allusion to the eagerly
wished for return of Old Sol: but for the most rosily beautiful description of the event
to be found in arctic literature commend me to Hayes’ gem of a paragraph which
discourages any attempt at imitation as completely as the effluguent rays of the
glorious sun pales the feeble light of the silvery moon.” It made the moon sick” was
the rather inelegant comment of Whistler.

Whistler by the way went gunning today and joining a snow slide goes whirling down
one of the precipitous bluffs of Bellot Island. He suffers no greater injury than the
wearing out of his pants. The United States Govt. however, sustains the loss of a rifle
which was broken in the catastrophe.

Bender is quite unwell. He is troubled with his lungs and I fear will hardly endure two
winters here. Temp -47.6 Mean: -39.69

A small party are making preparations to cross over to Hall’s rest.

## Wednesday March 1st 1882

Lt. Lockwood, Jewell and Brainard with Frederick and the dog team start for the Greenland coast by way of Beechy. Long goes to support them so far as Beechy
with Jens and the other team. Their object is to examine the condition of the
provisions left by Polaris and English party on the other side to decide to what extent
they can be depended upon for the sledge journey in the spring.


The quarters are still lumbered up with lumber, sledges, boats, canvas shoes,
etc. Cross is at present wholly engaged in keeping the boat painted red. While he
decorates one side the other is kept bare for him by the loose trousers of the passerby.
Our pants all appear to be of the same material now—at least they are all red.

Light snow, sun obscured. I have not yet seen the sun. Henry discovered a fly
in the vessel of rum that has been placed in the observatory to show the effect of low
temperatures. It must have been blown from the cracks of the observatory where it
has probably lain since the structure was made in “God’s country.”

Some members of the party — strange to say — go much further to explain the presence
of the insect. They all agree however that the fly’s lives had “fallen in pleasant
places”. Brainard has found a petrification.

## Thursday March 2nd 1882

I start with Connell and Ellis to see if the musk ox meat there is alright. A cold
tramp took us to the tripod I erected last autumn; but instead of two fine carcasses I
left suspended there, there was two skeletons of great value, no doubt, to the
anatomist, but of no value to us, nicely prepared by the wolves and foxes.

Not wishing to have our trip entirely without any useful result, I hauled a bag
of coal from the mine down to the ice foot. We arrived at the Station at 5 p.m. Dr.
Pavy, Linn and Henry have brought in the petrification which appears to be the
section of a large pine tree. This is an opening for all manner of conjectures as
regards the former condition of this region — now so completely barren of vegetation.

Lt. Kislingbury and Israel go to Mt. Campbell. They saw a hare but did not get
within range. Long returns at 5 pm: states that Lt. Lockwood and party started to
cross the channel at Beechy this morning. Temp. Min: -35.8, Max: -27.6, Mean:-


## Friday March 3rd 1882

No sun today. I therefore gave up my notion of ascending Cairn Hill. Light
snow during the afternoon. Bender is better. Connell was out hunting. More red paint.
Temp Min: -36.5 Max: -26.5, Mean: -31.7


## Saturday March 4th 1882

Cloudy and sunny weather today. Biederbeck and I walked to Dutch Island
and returned about 4 p.m. It was then quite stormy in the Straits.


No sun — Dr. asked me to walk after dinner and he talked over plans for the North
trip — see private journal — -Max:- 32.1 , - Min: 38.6, Mean: -34.9


## Sunday March 5th 1882

It snowed last night but cleared up this morning and Dr. Pavy and Linn with
dog team and driver Jens started for Cape Sumner Greenland to carry provisions for
the use of the sledging party which will go in that direction. They started at 7:45 a.m.
Connell and I started up Cairn Hill to get a view of the strait. We had a cold time of it
the temperature was about -40 and
a good breeze blowing making the cold almost unbearable. I would sooner endure -70
and calm than have -25 and the air in motion, Whistler and Salor walked around
Bellot Island.

While on Cairn Hill with Connell I saw the glorious sun for the first time in
142 days. Old Sol has been due for 6 or 7 days, but the bad weather, has kept from me
the pleasure of seeing him. Although I am the only member of the party who did not see it on the 28th Feb.

It was a glorious sight that can only be appreciated by those who have passed
through a long night of four months. See something slushy on this subject in private
diary this date. A quite dreary Sunday night, snowy and drifting outside and thoughts
of home and friends crowding thick and fast upon us as we listened around the fire.

Temp Max: -28.6 Min: -44.1, Mean: -36.04



## Monday March 6th 1882

Storm still continues. As soon as the snow ceased to fall a party dragged the
small boat “Discovery” — one left by the English out to Distant Cape. We are certainly
fortunate in the selection of winter quarters here.

The wind was (blowing) but one mile per hour while at the same time the
anemometer at Dutch Island registered 22 miles an hour. Temp -27.0, -36.5., 30.18

## Tuesday March 7th 1882

Lt. Kislingbury shot two hares today. The light is increasing daily. At 5 a.m.
this is quite a bright twilight. Temp. Min: -44.7, Max: -22.8, Mean: -37.0
