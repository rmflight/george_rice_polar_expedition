## Thursday October 6, 1881

Our chief object in visiting the Bellows was to have the muskox meat left by
the party in Sept. from the place the cattle had been killed to the icefoot that it might
be convenient for a party to take home to camp.

Arose at 6:30 a.m. Cooked breakfast over our alcohol lamp. Minimum temperature
recorded -24 during night.

Started for a load of the meat, found it about 2 miles from the shore, and
brought down one carcass, a difficult matter to drag the sledge with such a load as the
stones were not covered by the snow.

It was very uncomfortable as a strong breeze was blowing causing us to suffer
much from the cold. It required the utmost vigilance to prevent our faces and hands
from freezing. Brainard had his nose frostbitten several times and despite my caution
I had my cheeks frozen. By 4 p.m. we had hauled four loads of the meat to the shore.
We then went to the tent and prepared a hasty meal, and at 4:30 started again for
another load. At 4 the thermometer read -18 and at 4:20 when we left the tent it
registered -20.

Returned at 7p.m. tired out and cold. The thermometer showed us the temperature had
fallen to -25° F.

## Friday October 7th, 1881

After another uncomfortable night we got up early to bring the last remaining
carcass of meat down. Temperature during night -25. Started for home station at
10:40 a.m. Arrived home at 5 p.m. It was then very dark and snowing steadily.”

A footnote “I made one exposure for negatives at “Bellows”.


## Saturday October 8th, 1881

Snow falling from 3:30 a.m. ‘till 6:10 p.m., The thickness of the ice measured
near tide gauge. Result of 5 ft. 7inches. Two mock moons were observed.
Temperature +6 to -6.


## Sunday, October 9, 1881

Light snow falling most of the day. Dr. Pavy and Whistler return from their
attempt to reach Cape Joseph Henry at 4:30 p.m. they were unable to reach it owing
to the straights being still open and no ice foot on which to travel near Lincoln Bay.


Temperature ranged from +1 to -16. Sunday services and rum as usual.

## Monday October 10, 1881

Weather very thick during day. Snowed from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Lt Lockwood
and Sgt. Jewell started to walk to Cape Baird at 8 a.m. Their object is to determine if
sledging to that point is practicable. They return at 8:40 p.m. We had become
anxious about them as it had become very dark. A party with lanterns met them
about 3 miles from camp. Thermometer, Maximum -1, minimum -11.9.


## Tuesday October 11, 1881

Israel took deep sea temperature today. Sgt Linn with the two Eskimos and
dog teams started for the “Bellows” to bring back a load of meat. Temperature,
Maximun -2 to minimum -19.


## Wednesday October 12th 1881

Lt. Lockwood started this morming with three men for the purpose of
establishing a depot at Cape Baird. Linn returned at noon with 927 pounds of
muskox meat from the Bellows. A Solar halo (mock suns) was observed close to the
horizon at 11a.m.

Very low temperature today, the thermometer reads from -8 to -25.9 —rather cool for
Indian summer.

## Thursday October 13th, 1881

“Brainard and I started for Mt. Ovibus, distant to base six miles. We rode part
of the way with Linn who was on his way to the Bellows after more meat. Mt.
Ovibus is estimated to be 2600 ft high. Our object was to reach the summit and
examine with the telescope the valley leading from Muskox Bay to see if it offered a
practical route to United States range of mountains. We were three hours in making
the ascent from base at some places the climbing was most difficult and found a
heavy deposit of snow at the top of the mountain. We were forced to use our 
snowshoes which we fortunately carried. It was my first attempt at walking with such
foot gear, and I found I could travel comfortably. We did not accomplish anything as 
the atmosphere was hazy and could see no distance. 
Reached home at 5:30 p.m.


Lockwood and party returned at 7:45p.m.
Linn got back at noon with the remainder of the Musk Ox meat from the Bellows.
Weather fair- low temperature
Maximum -11,
Minimum -27.4
The above thermometer readings are for the 24 hours froml2 midnight to 12
midnight. The same now applies to all the temperatures I have herein recorded.

## Friday October 14, 1881

Weather fair, a Solar halo was observed between 10 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.
The sun has condescended to shine for such a short time each day for a long time.
Today Lt. Greely somewhat startled us by announcing that today was the last on
which we would see the sun ‘till at least the 29th of February. We all rushed out door
and sure enough Old Sol only exhibited himself for a few moments and then set in a
glorious glow of colors. The refraction of its rays presented a beautiful effect in the
horizon for some time after. Ther. ranged from maximum -10 to minimum -27.4.


## Saturday October 15, 1881

Weather fair. Two mock moons -----appeared at 5:30 p.m. and disappeared at
ll p.m. They displayed vertical rays of light.
Temp. from -10 to -27.4


## Sunday, October 16, 1881

Weather fair. “Deep sea temperature (taken every fifth day) was again taken
today. Nineteen and one half new inches of new ice had formed since the last hole
was cut in ice. An aurora observed at 7 p.m. lasting about 20 minutes. It was
perfectly white.
Very low temperature (Max -18 Min -32)

## Monday October 17, 1881

Cloudy weather, cleared up at 3 p.m.
Temp. Max.-10 Min. -29



## Tuesday October 18, 1881

Clear weather. Sergeant Linn, Connell and Henry started for the coal mine a
Watercourse Bay to get out coals. They returned at 3 p.m. They found no difficulty
in tumbling down several tons of coals. On their way over to the mine they found the
ice cavern or grotto mentioned in Sir Geo Nares’ work.
(Max -11 Min -33.9) Cool


## Wednesday October 19, 1881

Weather clear, partly cloudy during latter part of day. I started with Jens the
Eskimo and a team of nine dogs to take a load from the mine to Cape Murchison a
pleasant dog drive. I arrived home at 3:45. Getting quite dark at that time. At 9 p.m.
an aurora was observed. Several meteors seen, the most remarkable by Israel at 9 pm.
Ther. From -16 to -29

## Thursday October 26th, 1881

The darkness is increasing rapidly. We are compelled to use artificial light
almost all the twenty four in the quarters. Jupiter plainly visible at 2:30 p.m. Connell
took coal from Watercourse Bay to Cape Murchison. Weather warm. -2 to -23


## Friday October 21st, 1881

Dr. Pavy left station at 9:30 a.m. for the coal mine, returning at 2:30 p.m. with
430 lb coal. Jupiter, Arctivas Capella , and Alpha Gemminium were plainly seen at
mid day. A new experience to see stars plainly shining at noon. (Max +4 Min -15)

## Saturday October 22, 1881

Sun ended at 12:30 a.m. Following stars visible at 1 p.m.; Marc Polans,
Vega, Capelle, Castor, Prelix, and Cygni. Jupiter and Arcturus are now visible during
the twenty four hours. An aurora was observed; the magnometer during the display
was ----disturbed. Temperature from (+7 -20)


## Sunday Oct 23, 1881

Lockwood accompanied by Sgt. Brainard, and Pvt. Connell started for Cape
Beechy. They took Eskimo Frederick and one dog team. They are to build


snowhouse at Cape Beechy for the accommodation of the sledging parties in the
spring. Ther. Maximum +7 to Minimum -20.

Usual Sunday services as follows; reading the Bible and prayer for the absent
and singing sacred and otherwise during the evening.

## Monday October 24th, 1881

Another load of coals from Watercourse Bay to Murchison Sgt Gardiner.
Temp from -2 to -15.9


## Tuesday Oct 25th, 1881

At 9:30 a Solar halo appeared ---above the horizon, color pink. This halo as
determined by it’s position and altitude was 23° above the sun. Maximum +7.
Minimum -10.


## Wednesday Oct 26th, 1881

Pvt. Ellis made another coal trip. Lt. Lockwood and party return from Cape
Beechy at 4:10 p.m. They succeeded in building a snow house which by two nights’
occupation proved to be comfortable. The weather continues comparatively warm
today from +8 to -10 was the temperature.

## Thursday Oct 27th, 1881

We were busy for an hour or two building an ice wall around the house. We
have been furnished with a few hours exercise every morning in constructing this
wall which will afford a shelter from the north wind. I have the honor of being
appointed Superintendent of Construction. The temperature still continues mild.
Maximum +2° F to Minimum -12° F


## Friday Oct 28th, 1881

Added another tier to the ice wall. Snyder and Biederbeck while taking a
constitutional walk in the evening were somewhat startled by hearing a wolf howling.
It was so dark they could not see him but distinctly heard his footsteps in the snow.
They were about a mile from the station but did not tarry. I’m prepared to certify that
O’Leary’s best time was beaten. Thermometer, Max. +5, Minimum -10.



## Saturday Oct 29, 1881

It is now getting quite dark during the day at midday. Polaris was Plainly
visible. Several displays of aurora were observed in the evening.

## Sunday Oct 30th, 1881

It is now fourteen days since the sun disappeared below the horizon and to test
the power of active rays still existing in the faint light reflected from sun at noon I
propose to attempt another photograph. Israel, Whistler started after breakfast and
took the direction of Distant Cape. We hauled photographic apparatus on Hudson
Bay Sledges.

I exposed dry-plate for about one hour about noon. Sun must have been 6° or
8° below horizon. Amused ourselves while plate was exposed—target practice with
rifle Whistler had brought along. Our Sunday evenings are generally spent in
singing. Lt. Kislingbury, Gardiner, Ellis & Schneider taking prominent parts. Their
repertior (sic) consists of old songs and older hymns. I sometimes assist with the
violin.

Usual quart of ram dispensed. Said rum is not a particularly delectable article
of spirits tasting more like diluted commercial alcohol than anything else. For the
first month or more we used the English rum deposited by the Nares expedition at
Cape Hawkes and appropriated by us. Our own ‘New England’ is a poor substitute.


## Monday Oct 31st, 1881

Weather clear. Sgt. Ralston & Pvt. Henry made a trip to the summit of Bellot
I. to read Max and Min thermometers. Max recorded since Sept 30 21.05 Min -33.8
All hands making preparations for an attempt to cross the Straits under Lt. Lockwood.

## Tuesday, Nov 1, 1881

Remarkable deposit of hoar frost noticed by the observers. Sufficient was
collected in gages to measure .05 of an inch. This measurement however includes all
that has fallen since last snowstorm but most of it fell this morning. I assisted Israel
in ascertaining the deep sea temperature.

Preparations going on all day for the attempt to cross over the Strait to Polaris
Harbor and “Halls Rest.” The men are exhibiting considerable ingenuity in fitting
themselves out. Our supply of clothing and paraphernalia for field work in this


climate is sadly deficient of much that is necessary. For foot gear especially we are
badly off. The cork soled arctics are much to heavy to walk in, Esquimaux boots we
have next to none and those few we have too small. There are not enough of the
buckskin moccasins to go around. I have not received a pair as they were issued
while I was out in the field. Dr. Pavy generally fits me out from his private store of
Esquimaux boots which is extensive.

By evening Lt. Lockwood and his party of seven men completed their
preparations packed their sledges with the provisions etc and pulled it out to Distant
Cape so as to allow a start in the morning free of the sledge encumbrance...

They returned at 5 p.m. An unusual dinner was prepared by order of Lt. Greely in
honor, I presume, of Lt. L’s departure on his hazardous attempt.

## Wednesday Nov 2nd 1881

Lt. Lockwood and party started this moming for Cape Beechy from which
point they propose to pass over to Polaris Bay. The load on sledge, an English one
formed here, weighed 1,100 — a heavy drag through the snow and over the icefoot.

I followed at 9:30 with dog sledge and Jens the Esquimaux. The plan is that I
am to support Lt. Lockwood, aiding him with the dog team until the arrival of Dr.
Pavy when I join him for a trip to Wrangle Bay to carry rations for the spring trip.
My team was composed of but 7 dogs as two of the bitches had newly born litters and
not the same number of serviceable dogs, 7, were left for the Dr. The load of 600 lbs
that we had on the sled was therefore too heavy. I met with the Dr. and Lt.
Kislingbury near Dutch Island and arranged with him to leave one bag of bread at
Murchisons to be brought on by his team as he expected to have a light load.
Overtook the party of Lt. Lockwood at Murchison at 2 p.m. They were plodding
along steadily and expected to reach Beechy by night. I furnished them with a drink
of chocolate I had brought warm in our sleeping bag and proceeding on advance. I
reached Cape Beechy at 7 p.m. and Lt. L and party at 8 p.m. We occupied the
snowhouse erected some time ago and were very comfortable I brought but one
sleeping bag as it reduced the weight on the sled and Jens the Eskimo and I occupied
it.

## Thursday November 3rd, 1881

Slept comfortably last night. Jens and I filled the
sleeping bag so that the warmth of our bodies was confined and kept us warm.
Temperatures during the night -17.


Lt. Lockwood started out with Jens and the dogs for Cape Murchison to bring two
bags of coal. He also intended to examine the small boat left in St. Patrick’s Bay by
the English in 1875. I, assisted by Ellis, put out rations and built a snow pedestal for
a telescope we had brought. Brainard with rest of party started back for remainder of
their load abandoned the night before. Brainard and party returns at 1:30 p.m. Lt. K
returns at 4 p.m. He forgot to bring sack of pemmican which was to be part of his
load. Mock moons observed at 8 p.m. Temperature -11.


## Friday November 4, 1881

Lt. Lockwood sent me for the boat at St. Patrick’s Bay. Started with dogs and
sledge. Returned with boat at 3 p.m. During my absence Lt. L and party made
attempt to cross the Straits. They took whale boat which made their load so
cumbersome that it was impossible to advance over the rough ice. They consequently
returned after a few hours. Lt. L proposes making another attempt with the smaller
boat brought from St. P Bay. Dr. Pavy and Lt. K arrived at snowhouse at 6 p.m.
They made but slow progress being 12 hours from home station. Dr. is on his way to
Wrangle Bay with more rations to be used in the spring campaign. I shall accompany
him with the other dog team.

## November 5th 188]

I observed an amusing tableau last night before retiring. The snow house not
being large enough to accommodate us all, Ellis Saler and Biederbeck pitched a tent
outside and occupied a sleeping bag large enough to hold three men. Ellis and Saler
retired and left the candle burning for Biederbeck who was making preparations for
cooking breakfast in the morning. I happen to look in the tent and was almost
convulsed with laughter to see “Old Mate”, one of the most disagreeable and mangy
looking of all the dogs, occupying the middle place in the sleeping bag left vacant for
B. He was lying on his side head on the pillow with one paw thrown lovingly over
Ellis’ neck. As I laughed he looked up and expression said as plainly as I can
interpret it: “It is all right. I am one of them.” At 9:30 Dr. Pavy and I started for
Wrangle Bay. Lt. Kislingbury accompanied him with one sledge and team and Jens
and I had the other one.

When we left Lt. Lockwood and party were making preparations for crossing the
Strait. They are repairing the boat I had brought from Murchison

We proceeded for a short distance when Jens told me that the little bitch
“Gypsy” exhibited symptoms of matemity. He tried to drive her back thinking she


would return to the snow house but she returned to the team. We then proceeded with
her. She soon became tired an ill and we carried her on the sledge. This reduced
our teams to six dogs each as three bitches were left at the home station with litters.
We had a difficult time traveling over much ground which was also icy. Camped at
7:15 p.m. in the valley.

## Sunday November 6th 1881

During the night Gypsy managed to enter the tent and while we were at
breakfast gave birth to two pups. After breakfast Jens and I built a small snow house
and placed the mother with the pups in it. I left some pemmican so that she would
not starve during our absence. We then broke camp and deserted her. 9:30 am. We
traveled all day and had a most interesting journey. We found the traveling very
good. At about noon we entered the lower ravine leading in a more easterly direction
towards Wrangle Bay.

(Drs’ sled) was on a much lower level than the one we were on and we made a most
exciting descent into it. Finding our efforts to hold the sledge back to no avail I threw
myself on the sledge. Jens dragged by the standards behind. The dogs started on the
full run and would not be controlled; the sledge however descended faster than they
and running away some rocks the lines became entangled and the sledge stopped.
Found good traveling in the lower valley and reached our destination Wrangle Bay at
2:30 p.m. It was then beginning to snow.


## Monday November 7 1881

Added our load of rations to the depot already established and started to return
at 1:30 p.m. and after a successful trip arrived at Snowhouse at 10 p.m. Learned by a
note left by Lt. Lockwood that he had returned home having failed.

## Wednesday November 8, 1881

I forgot to state in yesterday’s entry that on our way back we found “Gypsy”
safe and sound. She had increased her progeny to triplets. We wrapped them all in
deer skin and brought them in on the sledge. After arriving at Beechy and while we
were feeding the dogs, one of the pups fell out and before we noticed it, became
partly frozen and afterwards died. Spent comfortable night and started for home 12


a.m. Shortly after we started it began to snow and the track along the icefoot was
difficult to follow. In crossing St. Patrick’s Bay we lost the track. Lt. Kislingbury and
the Dr. considered us as going too far into the Strait, while I contended that we were
already too far up the bay. We found ourselves among hummocks and I left the sledge
and proceeded ahead. I persisted in keeping out in the mouth of the bay and at last
found the old track. We arrived at home station at 7 p.m. Learned that Lt. Lockwood
and party had only arrived a few hours earlier. They found it impossible to cross the
Strait on account of the moving ice in channel and also the soft slushy ice that would
neither bear a foot passenger or allow boat to pass was another impediment. They
started for home from Beechy on the 7th when near the entrance of St. Patrick’s Bay
they found the icefoot overflowed with the exceptionally high tide they had that day.
Most of the party got their feet wet and wanted to go into camp at once. Lt. L.
however advised keeping on till Cape Murchison was reached. As soon as they could
examine their feet several found them badly frozen. Biederbeck was dragged in on the
sledge and will probably loose his great toe.

## Wednesday, Nov 9th, 1881

I have concluded to omit the entry of the daily temperatures until the
comparative readings now being made will furnish us with a correction for the
thermometers. At present the readings are considered slightly incorrect by Lt. Greely.
I will afterwards enter them as -----notes. Today the weather is clearing., with falling
temperatures. No aurora was observed.


## Thursday November 10th, 1881

The parties are engaged for a short time each day in outdoor work. Some
remove the ice forming on the tide gauge; others bank up the house etc. I spent about
an hour each day in hauling ice with Jens and a team of dogs. The ice is for
conversion into water for daily use. An aurora was observed early this morning, also a
faint streamer in the evening. A lunar halo of 22° was seen at 6 p.m.

Considerable excitement over two fires that occurred today. The first was
insignificant occurring in the lean to while Saler was filling lamps. The one caught
fire but was smothered before any damage done. About 4 p.m. Ellison was in the
carpenter tent and attempted the experiment of filling a gasoline lamp without
extinguishing it. He made a very successful failure, but will not likely again try it. In
an instant he was enveloped in flames the whole can of fluid igniting. He rushed out
shouting “Fire!” Our two Babcock extinguishers were brought into (?) and after a


short time the fire was subdued but not before some more tools and clothing was
destroyed. Ellison was badly burned.

## Friday November 11, 1881

Ellison was badly burned. His face and hands are excoriated so that they
appear raw. He presents a sorry appearance. Weather is fair. I hauled four loads of ice
and will continue to do so until the moon leaves us as after that the light will not be
sufficient. Two mock moons were observed from 9:45 to midnight. Weather is
growing colder.


## Saturday November 12th, 1881

Today we experienced the lowest temp so far. Weather clear during the day,
but cloudy at night. It did not affect us very unpleasantly (the cold) and our outdoor
avocations were carried on as usual.


## Sunday November 13th, 1881

Our usual Sabbath varying the routine of the week by its accompanying divine
service in morning and issue of grog at night. The day generally spent in reading and
sleeping. In the evening some hymns and old songs were sung with a strong chorus.
Weather continues to keep fine and clear. Two mock moons appeared at 10:30 p.m.
and passed away at midnight. No auroras were observed.

## Monday November 14th 1881

Lt. Greely commenced work on the pendulum piers in the lean-to today.
Gardiner and Connell assisted him. They succeeded in getting a good foundation laid
using quick plaster of Paris and cement. With the Eskimo and dogs I have hauled my
quota of ice; the tide gauge measured the ice formed in the pool at the (?).
Auroral streamers now observed at noon and continued at intervals during the
afternoon and evening.
Sgt. Israel was engaged in taking magnetic observations which continue for three
days during each month.



## Tuesday November 15th 1881

The weather’s still cold. Several acids and oils were placed in the instrument
shelter to determine the relative freezing point. They all became much denser in a
short time. Coal oil assumed the consistency of syrup.

Light snow 3:45 p.m. to 11 p.m.

“Lt. Greely today issued order No 9 to the effect that Thursday Nov 24 will be set
apart as a day of Thanksgiving corresponding with the day observed as a holiday in
the United States. It is proposed that we shall make it a holiday and engage in races
rifle matches and other amusements. The commanding officer offers prizes to
contestants in the different matches.

## Wednesday Nov 16th, 1881

The moon left us today. Lt. Greely and two men engaged on the pendulum
piers. Others hauling work ----in addition to the usual routine of outdoor work. Lt
Lockwood, Henry and I have decided to start a paper which is to be called the “Arctic
Moon” and will appear bi-monthly. We issued a prospectus today informing the party
of our intentions and soliciting contributions and subscribers.


## Thursday November 17, 1881

I hauled some ice this morning, although the moon has disappeared there is
significant light to work by. Lt. Lockwood with two men was engaged in finishing the
ice house in the harbor which was commenced some time ago. It is proposed to use it
as a shelter for a self-registering tide gauge.

In laying the foundation of pendulum piers the temperature of the earth at a
depth of 18 inches was found to be 7°.0, the temp of air — 5.0. This is in the shed or
lean-to adjoining officers quarters.


## Friday November 18th 1881

The programme for Thanksgiving was arranged today. The
amusements will consist of a snow-shoe race, foot race, shooting race, and most
interesting of all, a dog race between two teams in harness to sledges. Jens and
Frederick the Esquimaux will be the drivers. A grand dinner will be prepared.


## Saturday Nov 19th, 1881

It was decided to have a thorough cleaning out of the quarters today. As the
building was inhabited while the work was going on I took a walk to Dutch Island
with Lt. Kislingbury. When we returned everything looked much brighter, cleaner
and more cheerful. The weather continues clear and comparatively, not very cold.”


## Sunday November 20th, 1881

Lt. Greely read to us a chapter from the Bible as usual and which, most of us
took a constitutional walk. In the evening Schneider’s violin and I furnished
instrumental music as an accompaniment to the vocalists engaged in rendering some
ancient hymns and songs. Weather clear.


## Monday November 21st, 1881

A clear day. Lt. Lockwood completed his ice house. The race course was
prepared by removing snow and placing stakes. The course is on the ice in harbor,
near the shore. The distance for snowshoe race will be 200 yards and return; foot race
100 yards straight away. The sledge race will be from Station to Dutch Island, a
distance of two miles, and return.

## Tuesday November 22, 1881

Lt. Lockwood, Henry and I were busy preparing our paper for press. It is to be
issued on Thursday. It appears that we shall have to depend on ourselves for original
matter as no contributors to our columns have made themselves known.

House was banked with snow at some exposed parts. Weather clear. A very brilliant
meteor fell at 10:30 p.m. from Zenith to horizon. No tail. Color blue.


## Wednesday November 23rd 1881

Brainard and Cross were experimented this morning on the feasibility of
lighting a short rifle range artificially for the use of the marksmen in the coming
Thanksgiving. They found that at 25 yds good light could be thrown on a target and
also sufficient for sighting the gun.

The pendulum piers are now sufficiently high; and the erection of an ice house
over them was commenced today. Weather clear, an aurora was observed at 9 a.m. It
disappeared in short time; was of ribbon formation.The cooks are making great


preparations for tomorrow’s dinner with the exception of the regulation turkey the
menu is of the real Thanksgiving flavor.

## Thursday, November 24th 1881

The day clear and favorable for the sports to be engaged in. Of course the
drawbacks of darkness and cold must be taken into consideration. We are
unfortunately in the dark period of the moon the presence of which would supply us
with all the light we would require. Thermometer over 60 below the freezing point
making this doubtless the coldest Thanksgiving day that has ever been celebrated.

At an early hour the men were all engaged in perfecting their arrangements for
the different races; the cooks preparing their (hands?) and even the dogs making
noisy demonstrations as if to show that they too entered into the spirit of the day.

After breakfast the first thing on the programme was the snowshoe race. It
was called for 10 am: but for an hour before that time the clattering of the shoes could
be heard through the quarters as the men tested the security of the fastenings. We all
repaired to the course on the ice in harbor which was staked out and very imperfectly
lighted. The distance was 200 yds and return. Eight competitors entered and a good
start was effected. And now the affair became most amusing to the bystanders. Many
of the men were not familiar with the cumbersome footgear and this added to the
difficulty of finding the way over the ill light course, made their progress most
awkward and erratic. The “Montreal Snowshoe Club” would have considered it a
strange exhibition. An unperceived piece of ice would trip some luckless fellow up
and away he would go floundering in the snow to serve as a footmat.
for his impetuous rivals who were following him with more haste than speed.

As soon as the unfortunate could recover his 2 x 4 feet he would probably be run into
by some fleet footed Mercury who could not distinguish him from the surrounding
snow in which he had been wallowing. Many were the mishaps before the goal was
reached.

Sgts. Brainard, Ralston, Gardiner came in and won the first three prizes. They
reached the home stake in the order in which they are named.

Prizes were:
1st Bot of pres. Peaches: 1 gill rum, (towel) and soap.
2nd 1 gill rum, towel and soap



We then repaired to the quarters where bets were settled and paid and other
wagers laid on the result of the approaching running race. I found myself the winner
of a large amount of tobacco (our legal tender) having backed Brainard against
Gardiner, who was the favorite.

I acted as stakeholder for the party and in that capacity handed over a large
amount of tobacco to the lucky gamblers,

The running race footrace now came up and after a tie between three of the six
contestants it was soon over and the first place won by Ellis, Henry second and Linn
third. Prizes; 1st 1 pt. rum, towel and soap, 2nd 1 gill rum and towel, 3rd 1/2 gill and
soap.

The rifle shooting came last and most of the party engaged in it. Henry won
the first prize (bot of pres. peaches, 1/2 pt rum and soap), Jens 2nd (1 gill rum, towel
and soap) and Cross 3rd 1/2 gill rum and soap. (over)
We were much interested in the result of the dog driving match between the two
Esquimaux. They were made to understand it perfectly i.e. the arrangement, and set
about harnessing up the dogs. While they were doing so we went inside the quarters
expecting to be notified when they were in readiness so that we might see and
regulate the start. However the canine Jehus took the matter in their own hands. We
discovered they had gone and patiently awaited their return. They came in shortly at a
terrific pace Frederick ahead thus winning the pipe and half pound of tobacco
constituting the prize.

Three auroral streamers were observed.

We were now ready for dinner which was served at 4 o’clock. I give here the
bill of fare which considering our distance from market was varied and palatable.

Our chef de cuisine excelled himself:

(Oyster soup, crabs, lobster salad, Eider Ducks, boiled ham, green corn, lima beans,
asparagus, jelly cake, fruit and sponge cakes, Peach pie, blueberry pie, vanilla ice
cream, coffee, warm biscuit, nuts figs etc.) After dinner grog was issued larger
quantity than usual and songs were in order.

Lt. Greely having appointed me distributor of the prizes I attached the said
role of each of the party and succeeded in getting up a most ridiculous dress suit for
the occasion: an old long tailed coat of Jewell’s was transformed by the use of shears
into a swallow tail of remarkable pattern, a dilapidated white vest, immense collar,
profuse jewelry manufactured by the tinsmith, and an immense pair of Esquimaux


boots completed the costume. Lt. Greely made us a short address after which I
conferred the prizes.

## Friday November 25th 1881

In chronicling our celebration of yesterday I lost sight of the fact that the first
number of our paper was issued yesterday. It made a very good appearance and we
the editors, thought it interesting. It was little appreciated however, by the majority of
the party. Henry’s department was the personal column and some of his lists although
perfectly harmless gave great offense to those who were alluded to. The bully
Whistler as usual made a complete ass of himself. Frederick also considered himself
greatly aggrieved. Although contributions had been solicited there was no response
except from Lt. Greely who sent in a short letter over “Occasional.” For my part of
the sheet see “Arctic Moon” of date Nov 24" editorial Artic Moon account of Lt. K’s
kindness to dogs Wrangle Bay trip, (?) from the Esquimaux, etc. Lt. Lockwood
furnished the preamble and heroic account of and adventure of Lt. Kislingbury and
Dr Pavy. 

An Auroral arch was observed at 6:45 and other at 9:55 a.m. The latter was the most
beautiful, exceedingly bright and of a delicate pale yellow color. Weather clear.
Temperature low.

## Saturday, November 26th 1881

Weather clear. An observation of the temperature of the sea was taken today
with the following result. Temp at surface 28°0. Thickness of ice 29”


## Sunday November 27th 1881

Temperature low. Cross while taking a walk had his ear frozen. Lt.
Kislingbury and I walked to Dutch Island as a constitutional. Notwithstanding the
exercise of great care on my part I froze one of my cheeks,

At 10 a.m. an auroral streamer was seen.

The laugh is decided against Sgt. Brainard today. He started with two or three
companions to walk to Dutch Island, which by the way, is the objective point of all
pedestrians, the intervening path being well beaten, and was not aware that the two
Eskimos had preceded him. It is very dark now and they had proceeded but half way
when by the dim light they saw what they supposed to be a pack of ravenous wolves


emerging from the ice hummocks and making for them. They were unarmed but
Brainard with great coolness told his companions to get their knives in readiness and
prepared to repel the onslaught of the ferocious beasts. Hastily opening their knives
some of them insignificant pen knives they stood in an agony of suspense until the
near approach of the animals proved them to be
dogs that had accompanied the Eskimos and had started on in advance to meet the
new party with demonstrations of delight and no belligerent intention whatever.


## Monday Nov 28th, 1881

Several appearances of auroral light were observed today. Temperature low. I
hauled six loads of ice with the Eskimos and dog team. This furnished me with an
amount of exercise which is beneficial, but arduous. I find the dogs more interesting
than one would suppose. They exhibit remarkable sagacity and intelligence. Nothing,
however, can overcome their propensities for fighting. During the couple of hours I
was engaged with them I noticed nine different encounters which were usually
general, no non-combatants to be seen.

They have divided into two parties and it does not appear possible to associate
one party with the other. I was only using one team and the other apparently jealous
of the preference shown the first barred the road at every point where it was possible
and contended the passage of the loaded sledge. I was compelled to precede the team
and drive them off. Lunar halo and mock moons were seen at 3:30 p.m. They
presented a beautiful appearance.

## Tuesday Nov 29th 1881

I hauled ice as usual in the morning. Jewell being ill I took the observations
from 4 p.m. until midnight. New aurora observed. Weather clear all day- lowest temp
observed -37.5° F.


## Wednesday November 30th, 1881

During the day the temperature fell to -43°. The Mercury froze at -37°.9.
While taking the 3 p.m. observation Gardiner while on his way to the tidal gauge fell
and fractured his leg above the ankle. I finished his tour and will take his place at
midnight. Being desirous of completing my knowledge of German and Biederbeck


wishing to improve his English we have made an arrangement by which we shall
interchange instructions in our mother tongues. We had our first lesson this evening.


## Thursday December 1st 1881

1 took up the duty of making the hourly observations again at midnight. The
most difficult part of the tour is that leading to the tidal gauge. We are compelled to
descend the steep bank to the ice foot and notwithstanding the quantity of ashes
sprinkled in the path it is slippery and unsafe. I’ve had several severe falls, the heavy
cork sole shoes adding to the uncertainty of the footing. Ralston has demolished
several of Bender’s tin candle lanterns by falling on them. We have accused him of
tobogganing on them after the style of the Montreal club. The weather is becoming
warmer.

## Friday Dec 2nd 1881

Temperature increasing. Weather fair. I did not state that Sgts. Ralston and
Brainard visited Mt. Campbell on Bellot Island for the purpose of reading the
anemometer and thermometer placed there permanently. The anemometer has
registered 657 miles since it was first placed in position on Oct 9th. Thermometer
showed minimum temp since Oct 31st to have been -38°0. Temperature of water and
thickness of ice in harbor: temp air -27, surface of water -29.1
Depth of 33 ft. 29°.2 Thickness of ice 33”
Snow began falling at 11:35 a.m. ending at 5:30 p.m


## Saturday Dec 3rd 1881

Weather clear except a short time at midday. Jewell is on duty again. Gardiner
is getting along very nice and hauled ice in morning. Frederick the Eskimo has for
some time appeared disheartened and has been making me the confidant of his
gloomy prospects, such as that of running away. Some days since Jens acted in the
same manner but we reassured them of their safety and security. They have both been
treated with the greatest kindness by all the party but as there has been little for them
to do for some time past they have become lonesome and homesick and doubtless
imagine all manner of things. As Frederick appeared to be very much in earnest today
I sat up at night to intercept any attempt on his part to escape.



## Sunday Dec 4th 1881

Two beautiful mock moons at midnight which lasted until 8 a.m. They
exhibited the prismatic colors. At 4 a.m. contact arches were formed. The mock
moons were about 22° from the real. An almost complete circle surrounded the moon
passing through the mock moons.(diagram)


## Monday Dec 5th 1881

Weather cold. Front put in the icehouse over pendulum. I exercised myself,
dogs and Jens in hauling ice.

A beautiful Lunar halo with mock moons was observed at 6 p.m.

The most interesting occurrence of the day was the lunar eclipse of the moon which
commenced about 10 a.m. and lasted for over an hour. It was almost a total eclipse
and the moon during the time exhibited different colors. An auroral streamer was
observed. (diagram)


## Tuesday Dec 6th 1881

Weather clear. I exercised by hauling ice as usual. Some members of the party
still engaged in the pendulum building.

## Wednesday Dec 7th 1881

Nothing of importance occurred to vary the monotony of our everyday or
night life. The usual exercise taken by the party is walking, hauling ice, working in
the pendulum shelter. This work lasts for an hour or two each day. The hauling of ice
falls to me and I shall be loath to give it up as it furnishes me with healthful exercise
much more exhilarating and beneficial than mere walking on account of the activity
required in following the sledge and assisting the Esquimaux in managing the dogs.
Weather fair. Lunar halo observed.


## Thursday Dec 8th 1881

Weather clear. Biederbeck went to Distant Cape for Hudson Bay sledge left
there by Jewell some time since. Nothing noteworthy occurred.


## Friday Dec 9th 1881

Weather fair. Sky clear. Pendulum building completed today.
