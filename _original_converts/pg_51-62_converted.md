## Saturday Dec 10th 1881

Lt. snow during the afternoon. Lt Greely issued an order for all hands to return
at 11 p.m. as he considers it demoralizing to sleep at all times as we do now, as there
is no difference in the appearance of night and day.

## Sunday Dec 11th 1881

Our usual Sabbath, differing very little from the other days of the week. Lt.
Greely read the passage which is usually read at the opening of Congress this being
the day on which the event occurs. In the evening several of the cavalrymen gave a
very amusing imitation of the Indian war dance as they have seen it on the Frontier.
The falling of a remarkably bright was observed at 6:30 p.m. accompanied by a very
loud report. Auroral displays were seen at intervals during the day; at some times in
the form of streamers and at others in a curtain formation. They were of remarkable
brilliance. At 2:30. we observed the brightest arch that has been seen since our
arrival.


## Monday Dec 12th 1881

Cloudy weather. Light fall of snow. Party working on an ice wall to break the
cold draught at the corner of our quarters. I hauled a few loads of ice as usual.


## Tuesday Dec 13th 1881

Today Jens the Esquimaux concluded he would vary the monotony of our life
by absconding. His elopement was discovered at breakfast time. He had been seen in
the early morning however and we naturally concluded that he had not traveled far.
After breakfast Lt. Greely instructed Brainard and I to start from a point outside the
Station and by walking in opposite directions discovered (Jens) tracks leading from
the Station.
It was about 8:30 a.m. when we started. Henry volunteered to go with me and
Whistler went with Brainard. It was very dark, the sky overcast and no moon in the
heavens. Fortunately for Jens light snow had fallen the day previous so that his tracks
could be easily found and distinguished from others. I soon found his tracks following
the beaten track towards Dutch Island. We communicated with Brainard and Whistler
who soon found us and we proceeded at a rapid rate expecting to overtake the fugitive
in a short time as the track looked fresh and we knew that he had been very long on


the road. After proceeding a short distance we thought it best to send back word to the
Station to follow us with a dog team in case Jens should lead us a long chase. Henry
and Frederick the other Esquimaux returned.

Brainard Whistler and I followed the trail expecting to catch up to Jens at any
moment for we could see unaided by any lights he had not been able to follow the
path directly but wavered on and off. With our lanterns we moved on very rapidly
until Dutch Island distant two miles was reached. Beyond that point the path is not
well defined as it has not been traveled since the last party came in from Cape
Beechy. We saw that our game had turned off at right angles towards the ice foot so
as to follow the coastline and avoid being lost in the ice. His track now became
difficult to follow much time being lost in keeping (?) of them. When about five miles
from the home we were joined by Dr. Pavy with Frederick and dog team. We kept on
at the most rapid rate practicable, two of us going in advance with the lantern, the
others following the track as we found it. The ice foot was very rough and the
darkness was so intense that it was impossible to select the most favorable route for
the sledge even if the erratic course taken by Jens allowed for it.
When near Distant Cape the progress was very slow and at one place I
dropped behind to allow the Dr. a better position behind the sledge. We had been
walking behind it intending to join him as soon as the point was passed. I had just left
the advance and being able to hold on to the standards of the sledge and depend upon
it for guidance. I blew out the candle in my lantern to economize our light. As soon as
I dropped behind, the sledge disappeared in the dark and in groping my way after it I
met with several severe falls. I did not go far before I slipped and was thrown
violently against a projecting piece of ice. It was several minutes before I could move
from my prone position on the ice, when I discovered that my shoulder was
undoubtedly broken. I regained my footing and appreciating the importance of
catching up with the sledge, I lit my candle under great difficulty presented by the
wind and the use of one hand only. I started at the best gait I could suffering intensely
and encountered several more falls in one of which my light went out and delayed
me. I expected the sledge to wait for me at the moment they discovered my absence.
It appeared they were so interested in the chase that my absence was not noticed or
they thought I was following at my leisure. I plotted along my candle burnt out. I
overtook the party at a point a little south of Cape Murchison distant about ten miles
to reach while our (treacherous) way traveled much farther. They had just concluded
to wait for me. On learning (of) my condition Whistler started to return with me.


Brainard and the Dr. continuing in the way intending to go as far as Cape Beechy and
spending the night at the snowhouse if they did not find Jens. Whistler and I made but
slow progress on the return as 1 was compelled to avoid jarring my shoulder. When
near Distant Cape Whistler began to complain of the cold, a few moments after he
began to talk incoherently and before a mere halfway to Dutch Island he was
delirious. My position was becoming rather unpleasant.
Whistler overcome by the cold, was entirely unresponsive and it took all my
will and ingenuity to induce him to walk. He was continually falling down and could
hardly resist the temptation to remain on the ice. I attempted to lead him and having
no light our footing was so uncertain that I was continually jarred by missteps which
caused me to suffer intensely from my shoulder. I had to cajole, coax and command
Whistler at every step to get him along. I began to fear for his life: had he refused to
move he might have died in a very few moments.

We got as far as Dutch Island when Dr. Pavy, Brainard and the Esquimaux
overtook us with the dog sledge. I at once gave the Dr. the state of affairs and told
him it was necessary to get Whistler to the Station as soon as possible. It was
necessary to make him run behind the sledge and we learned on reaching the Station
that when near the Station they had to place him on the sledge as he had lost all use of
his limbs.

Brainard and I reached the Station at 4 p.m.

We had been out about 8 hours, traveled at least twenty miles with the
temperature at -30 on one of the darkest days of the winter. Whistler was delirious for
several hours, his nose and cheeks frozen but otherwise he suffered no bad
consequences. Dr. examined my shoulder and found fracture not complete but the
bone evidently cracked and ligature injured. Jens was overtaken a short distance
beyond the point from which we started to return. He came back quite penitently but
did not attempt to explain the cause of his strange conduct. Light snow was falling
almost all day.

## Wednesday Dec 14th 1881

A few days ago Lt. Greely requested me to try and arrange some sort of
entertainment as a diversion for the party the time hanging heavily on our hands at
present. I found it impossible to carry out any such plan successfully as our party is so


small that after making a cast of performers there would be but a small audience
remaining. Then it would be impossible to rehearse or arrange anything except in the
presence of the others so by the time of the performance the programme would be
stale and uninteresting. I therefore gave up the idea but suggested to the men that we
should invite Lt. Greely to lecture before us. They were pleased with the suggestions
and I made our wishes known to Lt. Greely. He kindly assisted and tonight favored us
with some interesting remarks on the Polar question: a subject absorbing to us at
present. An Aurora observed at 8p.m.


## Thursday Dec 15th 1881

The party are exercising by banking up magnetic observatory. My shoulder is
very painful; sleep is almost an impossibility. Frederick the other Esquimaux has
exhibited the desire to follow the example of Jens. In a melodramatic manner he
flourished a huge wooden cross in one hand and with the other on his heart bade us
all “good bye” intimating that he was tired of life and about to immolate himself on
the Shrine of the Polar Question. We dissuaded him however.
Temperature Max -27.4° F Min -46.2° F

streamer observed. Range of the observed and corrected from -38.2 to 46.2


## Sunday Dec 18th 1881

Israel commenced taking magnetic observations the usual monthly lasting
three days , today. Usual Bible reading in the morning. Ther. Obs. And Cor. Ranged
from -40.2 to 46.7


## Monday Dec 19th 1881

Began reading new tide gauge, and Gardiner up for first time today.


The heavens were filled with auroral displays all day too numerous and varied to
describe, but some appearances very beautiful. Ther. from -41.2 to -49.7. Obs and
corrected.

## Tuesday Dec 20th 1881

Two meteors were observed falling today, one of them exhibiting a beautiful
rosy colour. A faint aurora was also seen.-40.2 to -46.7° F was the range of standard
thermometer observed and corrected.


## Wednesday Dec 21st 1881

My shoulder is very painful. I think it is much more seriously injured than
appears in examination which can only be superficial. Today is Brainard’s birthday
and his bill of fare furnishes us with a splendid table for dinner. Deep sea temp. taken
by Henry. Standard thermometer read from -40 to -46.7 today observed and
corrected, correction is -3.8


## Thursday Dec 22, 1881

Weather much warmer, light snow began to fall at 11 a.m. Temp ranged from
-26.6 to -28.8. obs and cor. Many jokes were made about the warm weather. One or
two of the party seriously observing that the day was uncomfortably sultry.


## Friday Dec 23, 1881

Snow continues. Weather still warm -23.3 —28.1
Cross is going around with a badly swollen cheek the effect of toothache.

## Saturday Dec 24th 1881

Salor’s birthday, occurring today was celebrated by the usual gastronomical
preparations for an extra dinner. Snow ceased falling at 3 p.m.
It being Xmas eve the presents kindly sent by some thoughtful parties in the
States were distributed by our commander amid much chaffing and sport. The
kindness of the donors was highly appreciated. The interest attending the opening of
the mysterious packages was very great. I found myself the possessor of a pipe
accompanied by a neat chamois skin bag filled with fine tobacco. I have no way of (?)


the use of the articles however and find the (?) to me, property something of an
elephant.

A handsome lap-robe intended for Ryan who returned on the “Proteus”, was
raffled for and although I came within one of winning Ellison was the happy man.
Egg nog was passed around and drunk to the health of loved ones at home but we
were compelled to admit that the same exhilarating beverage imbibed by our friends
was superior to ours. The eggs which were preserved and rather mummy-fied.
We have managed to arrange a programme for Monday night which will require but
little preparation. Temp. obs and cor -33.6

## Sunday December 25th 1881

Light snow fell part of the day. Weather cloudy remainder. A very quite
Christmas. Lt Greely read a chapter from the Scripture as usual on Sundays. Our
dinner was the main feature of the day. A copy of the bill of Fare can be seen on a
page previous to this. Considerable sleeping indulged in as we all feel rather fatigued
after last nights dancing. In the evening an extra quantity of the (?) in the form of
New England rum was issued the exhilarating effect of which added to the pleasure of
looking over the fine illustrations in some London Graphics of a late date enabled us
to pass a very enjoyable evening. It was impossible however to prevent our minds
from wandering over snow and ice to the homes of friends and loved ones so vividly
brought before us by the season of Christmastide. We think there was not one of our
small party who did not indulge in a retrospective view of the events and
surroundings of our last Xmas. Ther. Obs and cor. Ranged from -24 to 39.9.


## Monday, December 26th 1881

Temperature stationary. -22.6 to -26.6, obs. And cor. After midnight last
night all hands being up and no disposition of retiring appearing a dance was
proposed. It met with such favor and was kept up till morning. Schneider and his
violin furnishing the music. I was unable to assist him as usual owing to the state of
my arm. There was much hilarity and no sleep secured, so after breakfast everything
became quiet, nothing occurring to break the silence but the regular snoring of one of
the sleepers. In the evening our entertainment came off a programme of which will be
here inserted.



## Tuesday Dec 27, 1881

Sea temperature observed today. Surface 29.1 and at a depth of 33 feet 28.8
Thermometer obs. And cor., Max. 27.1, min. 37.4

## Friday Dec 30th 1881
“Nothing noteworthy” -32.4 to 46.7 was the range of temperature.


## Saturday Dec 31st 1881

A cool but pleasant day. The evening was given over to Bacchus and
Terpsichore. I removed my arm from the bandages and attempted to relieve Schneider
in furnishing music for the dancers but found the positions of holding the violin a
painful one for my shoulder. Temperature from -34.1 to -46.2


(New year - 1882 begins)

## Sunday January 1st 1882

This is my first opportunity of setting down the new '82. Jewell and Lynn
started for Mount Campbell the highest point on Bellot Island to read the anemometer
and thermometer placed there. After several hours search they returned without
finding them.

At 4 p.m. we sat down to our excellent New Years dinner—the turkey. The
temperature comparatively warm -21.1 to -29.1. Most of the party enjoyed a siesta
during the day as they were somewhat exhausted from watching the Old Year out and
New one in.


## Monday January 2nd 1882

Two mockmoons observed at 1:25 p.m. accompanied with lunar halo and
aroral arches. All disappeared at 4 p.m.
Temp still warm -21.1 and -26.6 obs. and corrected


## Monday January 3rd 1882

Brainard and I started for Bellot Island. We were gone five hours. Found the
instruments and made the observations. Traveled on snow shoes most of the way.
Temp today from -24.6 to -36.2 obs and corrected.

We found them on Mt. Campbell read only -20 showing a warmer strata at that
elevation. This was my first walk from Station since my accident.

## Wednesday January 4th 1882

The arrangements for taking pendulum observations are now all complete.
Israel is awaiting clear weather so that astronomical observations for time can be
taken. Hourly watches to continue through twenty four hours announced today. The
true time is recorded at which the tide rises or falls an inch. Lt.
Lockwood lectures in the evening on “Sledging.” His remarks were principally
quotations from the accounts of former arctic explorers and must have cost him
considerable labor and research. Temp -25.5 to -33.6. I did not state result of
anemometer reading on Bellot Island by myself and B. Velocity of wind since Dec 1st
4,210 miles.



## Thursday January 5th 1882

Tide gauge observations continued. Two mockmoons were observed. Temp. -26.8 to 37.6 obs. and corrected.


## Friday January 6th 1882

Israel commenced surveying the pendulum today assisted by Connell who ran
the chronograph for him. Temp -34.1 to 42.2 obs. And cor.

## Saturday January 7th 1882

Pendulum observations continued. Temp -28.2 to -33.6. Obs. And Cor.


## Sunday January 8th 1882

Our usual Sabbath. Bible reading by Lt. G. in the moming; the remainder of
the day very quiet until 7 p.m. when the ration of rum is issued after which
conversation flows fast and furious. This New England rum of ours appears to contain
more volubility and eloquence to the square yard than any stimulant hitherto
administered. An argument can be readily started on any topic on Sunday evening.
Temp observed and corrected -28.2 to -49.2.

The sun light at noon is gradually growing brighter. Lt. Kislingbury could
read the time indicated by his watch by it today.


## Monday January 9th 1882

Today experienced the coldest temperature yet observed by us. The ther.
ranged from -44.0 to -56.4 obs. and corrected.


## Tuesday January 10th 1882

A still lower temperature from -47.2 to -57.2. obs. And corrected. Israel in
taking signal observations at astronomical observatory, froze his toe.

## Wednesday January 11th 1882

Weather still continuing cold. Lt. Greely favors us with a lecture on “The
Poles” which | did not have the pleasure of hearing as I was assisting Israel at the
observatory.



He has so much trouble and difficulty in manipulating the instruments and freezing
his fingers that I thought I might save him some of it by sending the signals of time
over the telephone for him. I was not of much service however. Israel’s work is very
hard in adjusting the transit, he inadvertently froze his nose against the frosty
instrument. While we were there the temp stood -45. Temp during day ranged from -
30.8 to 52.9 observed and corrected.


## Thursday January 12th 1882

Ellison’s birthday. An excellent bill of fare for dinner. Temperature from 31.4
to 36.9 obs. and cor.


## Friday January 13th 1882

Clear weather. Ther. ranged from -37.0 to -53.2


## Saturday January 14th 1882

Light snow fell during day. Began falling at 10:40 a.m.
Max temp 36.1, min -56.4. Obs & Corrected. No pendulum observations taken on
account of the stars being observed.

## Sunday January 15th 1882

Light snow falling till 6:30 p.m. Maximum temperature -26. Min. 37.1


## Monday January 16th 1882

Today we experienced the most severe storm I have ever witnessed.
Barometer began to fall a little after midnight, 15th, a light breeze setting in from the
west at that time. Sky clouded up at this time a small space at the zenith only being
partly clear so that a few stars could be seen shining through. Barometer showing
more decided fall as the morning advanced. At 8 a.m. slight fall of snow began wind
sprang up from SW, blowing 4 miles an hour. The remarkable fall of barometer
induced Lt. Greely to have it observed every 15 minutes. About now the expected storm came in full
force, Ralston who was on duty found great difficulty in reaching the instrument
shelter when the violence of the wind blew out his candle. He returned and Jewell
accompanied him. They succeeded in reading the thermometer of -12° 5 a remarkable
rise of 17 ° 8 since 7 a.m. Brainard read the tide gauge. By the time 1 o’clock came
round the storm had so increased in violence that although several relays and relief


parties attempted to reach the instrument shelter none were successful. Connell and]
started for the tide gauge but had not struggled through the blinding drift before our
lantern
was extinguished and we were compelled to return to the Station. I cannot describe
the fury of the storm. It was intensely dark, the wind was howling out of the N.E. at
the rate of 60 miles an hour carrying with it clouds of frozen snow that cut the face
like powdered glass or sparks of fire. The resistance to the body was tremendous, it
was impossible to move in an upright position. We lost the path and tumbled over the
hill to the ice foot making no attempt to save ourselves. On returning two volunteers
joined us and we started again with a red signal lamp. It was Brainard and Biederbeck
who accompanied us, their success at 12 o’clock causing them to (?) our attempt. We
all stumbled precariously over the bank but could not find the path. We crawled along
a short distance when someone behind me said “Let’s try and get back.” Biederbeck’s
red light showed up a little in advance however and we followed it and succeeded by
mere chance in reaching the snow house over the tide gauge. Our return was not quite
so difficult but we had hard work and returned to the quarters bruised and almost
frozen. Our faces were covered with a sheet of ice. Observations were now
discontinued at the shelter and a thermometer was exposed at the side of our building
near the door. At 2:30 p.m. the anemometer cups were blown away. Several tents
were blown down and other damage done. The highest velocity recorded before the
anemometer blew away was 65 miles but there is not doubt it increased afterwards
and we are inclined to think 80 miles per hour not too high an estimate. It was during
a lull just before 12 o’clock that the winds shifted around to N.E. where it remained
during the remainder of the storm. It ceased to blow with great violence after 4
o’clock but a stiff breeze was felt all day as soon as the observation at the instrument
shelter and the tidal gauge resumed. Life lines were placed for the guidance of the
observer.

Temp -11° .0 to -31°.1 obs. and corrected


## Tuesday Jan 17th 1882

Snow ended at 3:30 am: clouds cleared away at 6am. Jewell observed the
temp of water and thickness of ice today. The working party engaged all day ia
repairing the damage of yesterday’s storm. Several tents had to be re-erected: the


commissary pile covered up, etc. I again went on duty observing. Temp from -22°.6
to -40.7 obs. and corrected.


## Wednesday Jan 18th 1882

This morning we were smoked out at an early hour by the pipe of our stove
choking up. Our heating arrangements are very poor, a good deal of gas is (?) and we
breathe much more of it than is compatible with health, especially as we have to
spend so much time indoors during the long and cold arctic night. As I note this the
sooty comets are falling on me and my surroundings. (see further remarks in private
journal)

Temps -31.9 to -47.1

## Thursday January 19th 1882

The period for monthly magnetic observations has come around and as Israel
is still engaged with the pendulum Ralston and Jewell will make the magnetic obs.
leaving the regular meteorological work to Henry and I. I find it very tiresome and
tedious work—hourly observations, 8 hours on and 8 off. Routine work never suited
me.

An auroral arch was observed at 7:35 and strong magnetic disturbances
disappeared at 8:30 and another brilliant arch flashed out at 10:30 but disappeared
instantly. -34.1 to -43.7 Obs. & Corrected. Gardiner’s 25th birthday. High tide 89
inches.


## Friday January 20th 1882

Pendulum observations continued. Israe] sticks very faithfully to the work
which is very difficult. Some New England rum supposed to be 10 above proof was
exposed when I went on duty at midnight and 1 made the following observations
regarding the effect of the low temperatures on it. At 2 a.m. a thin coating of slush
formed on it—temp -41.7, at 3. slush 1/2 inch in thickness at -44 temp. I again
examined it at 5 a.m. and found that it had thickened to the bottom of the vessel
resembling somewhat snow saturated with water. Our highest tide was observed
today 8 feet 6 inches. The highest observed by the Discovery while here was between
6 and 9 feet. Temp obs. and cor. -31.8 to -47.4
Cross’ birthday.
