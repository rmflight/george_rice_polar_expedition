The subject of gas was agitated considerably today. The effects of the gas
evolved from our stove has become a matter of grave importance. There are few of us
who have not felt the pernicious effects of it—spending so much time indoors as we
are compelled to do—and it is time some change was made in the stove’s pipe to
prevent it. Temp. Max: -32.2, Min: -37.6, Mean: -34.27


## Thursday March 9th 1882

Lt. Greely sent me with Connell and Biederbeck to Lake Alexander (actually
Alexandra) to ascertain the thickness of the ice there. Ralston accompanied us as far
as Mt. Ovibus which he ascended to get a view to the N.W. towards United States
Range. We had a cold time of it; were 9 hours gone and had our noses frozen
repeatedly. We were several hours getting through the ice which we found to be 80
inches in thickness.

We were compelled to commence with a large hole at the surface so that there would
be room to work when the hole deepened. At last the digger found the ice above his
head on all sides. We found that Dr. Pavy and Linn had
retumed from the Greenland side having deposited their provisions in Gap Valley.

Linn gave me an instance of Jens toughness: Linn, after one of the hardest
days work traveling through a storm was so completely tired out that he at once
crawled in the double sleeping bag and fell asleep. Jens, after attending to the dogs,
came in the tent to sleep but supposing Linn to be ill, laid outside the bag all night. He
must have spent a terrible night as the temperature was below -40!

Crazy Jane,—one of the dogs, called Milatook by the drivers, — amused us
very much with her antics when a seal skin shoe was placed on her sore foot. She had
the most ludicrous manner of holding it up and inspecting it. Lt. Greely made the
ascent of Cairn Hill. Henry complains of rheumatic pain and Israel takes his place on
observations.

Max: -26.1, Min: -36.6. Mean: -31.7


## Friday March 10th 1882

Bean dryer to work all day. Weather comparatively warm. I walked down
with Dr. and we talk over plan for his northern trip. Linn’s experience with canvas
boots does not encourage us much to believe in their suitability.

Temp Max: -18.8 Min: 29.7 Mean: -23.05


## Saturday March 11th 1882

I was testing some thread for Lt. G to see if it could support sufficient weight
to allow it to be used for deep sea sounding.

Israel and I took sea temperatures and measured thickness of ice in harbor.
Max: -10.7 , Min: -18.9. Mean:-13.19

## Sunday March 12th 1882

I went to Distant Cape and from there proceeding some distance on the ice to
ascertain if it was fit to travel on in the direction of Polaris Bay. Connell accompanied
me. Found the walking very bad and did not proceed further than 2 or 3 miles in the
Strait. The traveling across from Distant Cape to Thank God Harbor is almost
impracticable. I should advise a person crossing to start at Cape Murchison as the
floes appear to be larger and less hummocky. We found the hummocks closely
packed and soft snow dumped between. A strong breeze sprang up as we started to
return. Lifting the snow in blinding sheets. Fortunately it was in our backs: it would
have been impossible to proceed to the fort had it been in our faces. We arrived at the
Station badly frozen up: faces coated with frozen snow and temiaks as stiff as sheet
iron.

In the evening Lt. Greely had some conversation with almost all the members
of the party, eliciting their wishes or willingness to go on the arduous sledge trips. To
the credit of all it must be said that great enthusiasm was shown; everyone quite
anxious to take part in the exciting 1f dangerous and arduous work. The commanding
officer asked me to take some photographs of the party before we start out. The Dr.
and I will start on 18th of this month. Later Lt. G interviewed me in regard to my
correspondence to NY Herald—see private journal.

Max: -8.9, Min: 29.8, Mean: 21.31

## Monday March 13th 1882

Everyone is busy today preparing the party to start for Greenland side with
boat and provisions; the boat to remain as a safeguard for the later party to return in
case the Straits are broken or open. Brainard, Biederbeck, Schneider, Elison Connell, 
Whistler and Linn will compose the party. They will gone seven days at least. I made


some negatives of the launch and ice foot. But in developing I found that the light
was still too weak.

Max: 29.9 Min: 36.6 Mean: 34.94


## Tuesday March 14th 1882

The party mentioned above started today. I accompanied them to Distant Cape
with Eskimo and dog sledge carrying part of their load. They all started off in good
spirits. I was much amused by Whistler’s request for fifteen leisure before starting to
commune with his photograph of some frontier inamorata of his whom he designated
as “Broncho Moll”. —see private journal.

My Eskimo Jens brought me back at a terrific rate using the 20 foot leash to
great advantage. Rushing through the cold air was like facing a biting breeze and in
spite of all my efforts I froze both cheeks. I found that the temperature had fallen ten
degrees while I was gone! Max: -35.3 Min: -45.3 Mean: 38.08

## Wednesday March 15th 1882

I was busy all day making some more photographs and preparing for our start
on Saturday. I made one negative of dogs hauling ice which turned out very well, the
dogs having kept perfectly still during the exposure. Lt.’s Kislingbury and Greely and
also Cross and Jens were included in the group.


## Thursday March 16th 1882

Almost crazed getting ready for our start. Clothing to be collected, cooking
gear to look after, etc. The Dr. has taken a wise plan; he and I had made a complete
list of all that we are required to take and divided this again and each of us looking up
and preparing the articles set down on our list and checking the same when added to
our pile in the lean-to. The brains are racked to remember every little thing as
anything left behind cannot be replaced.

Max: -32.1 Min: -42.2.


## Friday March 17th 1882

Was a cold St Patrick’s day, Max:-30.6 Min:-35.6



## Saturday March 18th 1882

Our preparations are now complete and will start tomorrow morning. A good
dinner and a quart of ardent enlivened the last evening we shall spend under roof for
some time.

## Sunday March 19th 1882

This morning at 9:40 a.m. accompanied by Jewell and Fred the Esquimaux we
made our start for the North. Jewell will return after supporting us as far as Lincoln
Bay. Our party will then consist of but three persons, Dr. Pavy, myself and the driver
Jens. Nine dogs to our team and 8 to Jewells. The morning was cloudy and a little
blustery but afterwards improved. I made a photograph of the outfit including myself
also in the picture with Gardiner to make the exposure. Lt. Kislingbury walked with
us as far as Cape Murchison where he bade us “Godspeed” and we pursued our way.
Temp when started was only -24 but was ten degrees lower when we reached Depot
“B” at Shift Rudder Bay where we arrived at 3:40 p.m.

We found the party of seven just returned from Greenland shore. Their
experience was a very trying and unpleasant one, and the temperatures they were
called to withstand were probably lower than have ever been recorded by parties in
the field. When their first camp was made the temp stood -53 and during the night fell
below -61 the point at which their thermometer was graduated and below which there
was no registry—the index point was forced below the scale and stood in the bulb.
Schneider gave up first day out from Depot “B” and was sent back to the snowhouse
with Biederbeck with nurse (see sledge journal) not one of the party has escaped
injured fingers and scarified noses and cheeks. The large party crowded us out
of the snowhouse so Jewell and I dug a hole in a large bank of closely packed snow
and in this we passed a fairly comfortable night. At an early hour we were aroused by
the seven sleepers arriving at our igloo to bid us goodbye and we drowsily pulled
aside the flap of our sleeping bags to reply to their salutation. Lynn crawled on top of
our fragile crystal palace to shout his good wishes the ventilation hole in the roof. To
show a proper amount of appreciation we turned our faces, Jewell and I, in the
direction from which the sound issued, when crash came a swaddled foot through the
snowy chill precipitating on our smiling upturned faces clouds and huge blocks of
frosty snow. Lynn avers that he saw clouds of sulphur escape as he beat a hasty
retreat to join his companions. Temp at midnight in hut -1 outside the thermometer
was ---39.



## Monday March 20th 1882

After the early start of Brainards party for the home Station we got another
nap. Started at 10 a.m.: the day gloomy and unpleasant. We found the traveling on ice
foot very good for some distance when we were compelled to take to the strait where
to ice was rough beyond description. The piled up masses of ice disputed our right of
way on the ice foot, and the straits were only to be traveled over the most disruptive
of rubble ice crushed into the greatest irregularity and unevenness by the tides and
currents in the fall before the frost cemented it together. It conveyed more the
impression of a stormy sea
lashed into fury and frozen instantly into immobility. Temp during day 20 below
zero but with a SE blowing made traveling very uncomfortable. Snow began to fall
and at 6:30 p.m. had so increased that we could not see our way and so went into
camp on the icefoot between Cape Beechy and Wrangle Bay. Jewell and I dug
snowhouse while Dr. and Jens fed the dogs. The moment we camped they curled
themselves like hedgehogs and the snow dusting about them soon enveloped them in
a white sheet beneath which they slept until the smell of chopped pemmican brought
them to their feet when it necessary for one of the drivers, me, to keep them in
abeyance while the others scattered the food in the snow. The restraint was then
withdrawn when there was a rush—snarl—and the frozen meal was dispatched at
almost one gulp by the wolfish animals. They then burrowed again the snow where
they remained quiet until near morning when they were sufficiently rested to again
prance around disturbing our rest by their snarling at and quarreling with each other.
The dogs of one team appeared to be the sworn enemies of the other and woe betide
the luckless dog that wanders into the enemies camp. Unless his friends, generalled
by the King dog, can come to the rescue, a sad remnant of caninity is all that will be
left to hobble back to his comrades. Barometer has been falling all day.

## Tuesday March 21st 1882

Weather was still thick and threatening when we emerged from our burrow in
the snow this morning. We did not get started before noon. The temp was mild -10,
but the wind was still blowing. We had great difficulty in proceeding, the high tides
harassing us along the icefoot. (I) know of nothing I can compare the nature of ice to.
I have never seen rocks on land so dispersed as to make so uneven a surface as the
rubble ice over which we traveled. One of us would advance with an axe to pick out a


route and reduce obstructions when necessary. The other, one at the upstanders
steering and pushing, the driver at the lines winding the dogs through the narrow
openings among the hummocks and rubble, followed slowly and laboriously and
notwithstanding our care the sledges (were) upset twice and the runner of Jens so
wrenched that it was necessary to unload and relash it. It is surprising the amount of
rough usage the Esk. sledges will stand. They are put together entirely with lashings
of walrus hide and when loaded—as they were—with over 600 Ibs. each, they will go
over a track of such roughness that the dogs themselves have to climb and jump over
the obstacle. One runner will glide up over a sharp block of ice from a few feet high
while the other falls in some crevice below. The whole weight is thrown on the latter
which is turned over on its side until it touches the crosspieces. Presently the sledge
will emerge bound off into a smooth place and land on its feet like a cat—the elastic
thongs bringing the runner again vertically under the sledge.

We arrived at Wrangle Bay at 7:30 and for the first time since leaving the
Station erected our tent which—intended to accommodate three—was too small to
shelter us all and Jewell and I made a small hole in the snow, just large enough to
admit of spreading out the sleeping bag where we spent a rather uncomfortable night
with the temp at only -24. My knees were swollen and rather stiff which made me
fear a possible attack of my old enemy the “acute”: but the morning reassured me to a
certain extent.

## Wednesday March 22nd 1882

Today after threading our way through some very rough ice we reached a
large floe of the paleocrystic ice of Sir George. On this ice the snow was sufficiently
glazed and hard to bear the sledges. We stopped at Mount Parry to pick up the cache
of provisions left there by the Dr. last autumn. On approaching the place we found the
tracks of large polar bear and on examination of the cache found that the brute had
eaten almost all the pemmican. He had also torn open the bag containing the hard
tack: but on not finding the contents palatable had scattered them among the snow
and turned his attention to the pemmican of which he made a lunch of almost 70 lbs!

Gathering up the remnants of the depot we proceeded, finding the traveling
very good over a strip of young ice that extended for a few miles towards Cape
Frederick VII. The icefront along this place presented a most remarkable appearance.
It was fully fifty feet high in an almost perpendicular wall and must have been created
under great pressure. The surface on which the sun blazed and glistened was as
polished and resplendent as a silver rampart studded with jewels.


We soon passed off the young ice and traveled over a succession of
paleocrystic floes which afforded even better travel than the season ice which was
covered with a salty effluence that made traction difficult. The only difficulty we
experienced was in passing from one floe to another where the edges were askew and
piled up, but even here the snow had drifted so that we could almost always find a
place where the chasm between the floes was edged over.

At 1 p.m. it was so calm and still that we stopped a short time to melt some ice and
quench our thirst. We were so comfortable and the weather looked so pleasant that we
were surprised to find that it was 36° below zero. We encountered some rough
traveling before we camped in Lincoln Bay about one mile north of the English depot
at 5:30 p.m. Jewell and I set to work to build another snowhouse on which we spent
two or three hours before its dimensions and finish suited us. We spent the (more)
time because we knew that it was to be our headquarters for some time while we are
advancing our provisions along the coast to the North.

Temperature at 6 p.m. was -35°

## Thursday March 23rd 1882

We spent a sleepless and uncomfortable night at temperature outside at -40.
We had no effectual way of closing the entrance to the hut and the cold air entered
without difficulty. Dr. cooked breakfast after which we went to the English depot of
rations and overhauled it. It was well snowed over and compelled us to use the shovel
a great deal but was otherwise in good condition. Jewell and his team of dogs with
driver having supported as far as had been arranged started to return to the Station at
12 p.m. He took with him 140 lbs of the canned Australian beef and a small quantity
of each of the following articles: onion paste, curry powder and tobacco. I was much
interested in the manner in which the two Eskimos parted company. They were fully
aware that at least two months would elapse before they would again meet and were
also sensible of the dangers to be passed before that time, yet no word or action
passed between them to show that any unusual feeling was entertained. I vainly
watched for some break in their stoical demeanor. They parted without even a glance
at being exchanged although I know they are sincerely attached to each other. It is
proof of that strange negative character so happily described by the observant Dr.
Hayes.

After Jewell was out of sight we spent the afternoon in picking out of the
depot the stores we intend to use. We also made some improvements in our
snowhouse building a vestibule of snow blocks to add to the warmth. Also made a


walk to pick out the most favorable path for the morrow. At 7 p.m. the thermometer
stood at -39.5.


## Friday March 24th 1882

The sleeping bag occupied by Jens and I was originally intended for one man
—a fat Governor in Greenland. For reducing our constant weights of load to the
minimum before started we concluded that by inserting a wedge shaped extension it
would accommodate two of us and save the trouble of carrying a bag for each. This
furry envelope naturally fell to the lot of Jens and I, the smallest ones of the trio, and
when we tried it at the Station—with lighter clothing on—it appeared large enough.

Our experience in the field however was not exactly as pleasant as we
expected. This part of my journal (as will appear obvious to the most superficial
observer) is written up from notes made from my sledge journal kept while on the
field. I will here transcribe verbatim my entry made on this date: Did not spend a very
pleasant night, sleeping bag too small for two of us and Jens and I have much
difficulty in squeezing into it after which “spooning” we can only turn by concerted
movement. Other movements are impossible. Fortunately Jens is much shorter than |
and our straddled feet reach different depths
in the bag. The door of the snowhouse open with temperatures outside of -56.2
(88 ° below freezing point). Dr. and Jens got up at 4 a.m. I at 5 a.m. I am now at 6
a.m. writing this outside and a glance at thermometer shows the temperature at -45°.
Have been wrestling for some time with my termiak which resembles a coat of sheet
iron and in my frantic efforts to put it on have split it down the back—(imagine the
hieroglyphics in which above entry was made in my diary with pencil held in band
encased in a dogskin mitten as large as a sofa pillow) — to continue later: --

We started north at 8 a.m. with heavy load. “Redeye” one of the dogs being
too big with pups was left behind in the snowhouse to which we will return after
advancing our load some distance up the coast. Temp at start -42°, at 11 a.m. -39. At
noon brisk breeze sprung up from 8. East and had so increased by 5:30 p.m. as to
force us into camp as the traveling was bad and drifting snow prevented us from
seeing the way.

The traveling during the day generally good although we were compelled to
shift from icefoots to straits and back again several times and had to unpack the load
twice and carry it over obstructions. The load was very heavy and when we stopped
dogs appeared tired.


We pitched our tents in a lee of a large hummock in the Straits, about 50 yds
from the icefoot. Dr. cooks supper while Jens and I feed dog and secure tents which
increasing wind endangers. At 6 a.m. temp -36° 1/2. As we were eating our stew and
drinking chocolate, the clouds of condensed vapor condensing and congealing against
the top of the tent, fallen again in a miniature snow storm covering clothes and
sleeping bags in a white sheet while it also falls down our backs and in other ways
aggravates us.

Thrusting my hand in the bag of ice Jens brought in I found the pieces like coals of
fire and withdrew it with the ice sticking as if like butter.

I have two toes suffering from frostbite and the fingers of all three of us are
more or less frost burnt.


## Saturday March 25th 1882

The wind increased during the night and at the usual time for starting it was so
strong that we thought it best to lay over for a few hours. At 12 noon we got up and
after some time in prospecting for a lead out of the labyrinth of ice by which we were
surrounded, we took to the icefoot which in this place is piled up in double serrated
lines as if created at different times. We were compelled to carry the light load with
which we started, piecemeal over about 75 yds. and in places had to cut footholds in
the slippery wall. We left our tent standing with sleeping bags and cooking utensils
intending to return to camp. The wind blew briskly although much moderated, but
fortunately in our backs. We reached Black cape at 8 p.m. Storms still light
(con’t)

and from an (elevated) icy pinnacle we could see a way to the North on the frozen
sea, a low dark streak that so resembled land that had we been the first to gaze in that
direction we should probably make the mistake of the Polaris people who placed
“Presidents Land” where later parties found a sea of ice. It was probably a dark
stratus cloud or some other illusory phenomenon.

We started to return after caching our load and reached the tent at midnight. Temp
when we started -27: while we were away -36, now midnight -32. Milatook was run
over by the sledge but the hardy mutt does not look any the worse for it.


## Sunday March 26th 1882

Temp during night—or morning-- -37° 5. We started back to Lincoln Bay at
10:30 a.m. with a strong breeze blowing and with temp of -33°. We had much


difficulty in keeping our noses from freezing. Poor noses! They are already swollen
and scarified by Jack Frost and our clumsy attempts to protect them with our dogskin
mittens brought the tears to our eyes—how gladly would the Arctic travelers dispense
with this troublesome organ while sledging! We arrived at snowhouse, Lincoln Bay,
at 4:30 p.m. wind had gone down. Temp at 5 p.m. -34.5 “Redeye” ok, but not yet a
mother.


## Monday March 27th 1882

Min temp during night -44: at 10 a.m. when we started back to our tent near
Cape Union (false) it had risen to -23. We had a considerable load but got along
swimmingly. The morning was beautiful calm and clear—“too fine to last” as the Dr.
remarked. About noon a light breeze sprang up from the south and kept steadily
increasing until between 2 and 3 o’clock p.m. It was blowing a gale and we became
anxious to reach the tent for shelter. We also feared it might be blown away before
we could reach it.

The barometer was falling alarmingly fast and the temperature was rising
rapidly—the south gale bringing warm weather.

At 4 p.m. we reached the tent still standing and fortunately sheltered by the
large hummock south of it. The wind was then blowing 30 miles an hour at least and
the temp was only down to -11. but even with this comparatively (warm) temperature
we could never have made the latter part of our days journey if the gale had not been
in our back for the searching wind pierced our forms and the face could not be turned
toward it except for the shortest possible space of time. We had a very unpleasant
time making our arrangements for the night, feeding the dogs, etc. At 6 p.m. temp -
11.5. Wind blowing hard as ever!

## Tuesday March 28th 1882

Spent rather an unpleasant night. The driving snow drifted against the sides of
the tent collapsing it so that our space was curtailed within the limits of comfort. We
were crowded upon each other and forced into cramped positions. The swaying tent
surged and shaken by the gale precipitated upon us the snow formed on the inside
which crept in the mouth of the sleeping bags and made our rest almost impossible.
The dogs outside crowded for warmth and shelter against the tent and at times howled
piteously.
Min temp during the night -25. at 6 a.m. -15; at 7 a.m. -20. at 8 a.m. we started at
Black Cape to add to our cache there. The wind began to moderate at 4 a.m. and


became more to the Eastward. At 11 a.m., it had calmded down entirely and the
weather was as smiling and beautiful as if no storm had ever disturbed the elements.

Our load was heavy and we were stopped repeatedly. At one time we were
compelled to unload and relash the runners which occupied one hour. Temp in sun -5;
in shade -18. Reached Black Cape at 3:30 p.m. Melted some ice, eat a lunch, and start
to return to tent at False Cape Union where we arrive at 8 p.m.—temp: -25.


## Wednesday March 29th 1882

Barometer showed another remarkable fall this morning. Temp (Min) during
night -43. I suffered much with pain in the limbs found on examination swollen to
twice the size of the other. Sleep was impossible. Started with empty sledge for our
snow home at Lincoln Bay to get the last load of provisions and maps, at 10:30 a.m.
and arrived there at 2:30 p.m. Temp at 3p.m. -29. at 7p.m. it had fallen -36.5


## Thursday March 30th 1882

The fall of barometer was followed by what it predicted. Stormy weather this
morning. Wind becoming strong from the south with clouds and drifts of snow. The
minimum temperature during the night was registered was -52 but the southern storm
brought it up to -15 at 12 p.m. A remarkable range!

Traveling was out of the question so we rigged up a (?) lamp to burn cocoanut
stearine which we found in the English depot, and attempted to dry our footgear.

My original entry in sledge journal in evening—outside—is later; later still
blowing and drifting from south with snow falling. My little finger was frozen while
writing this

## Friday March 31st 1882

Having slept part of the day yesterday I did not go to sleep until near morning.
I laid outside the sleeping bag and kept the stearine lamp going. An old number of
Litteil’s furnished me with reading matter. On starting out in the morning I found that
we were completely snowed in — our vestibule full of drift. I found that I could not
ignite the matches which I attributed to dampness and as the only alternative started
for the English depot where we knew there were several boxes of dry ones. Had much
difficulty in effecting an exit. Fortunately we had a shovel within and with it I dug my
way and seeing daylight through the snowy shell forced my head and shoulder
through it to the open air. While doing so I found breathing difficult and several times


while shoveling I felt faint and almost unable to continue. This showed us that it was
foul and nephitic air, and that it was due to this the matches would not burn.

The storm had ceased and only the drifts showed the effects of yesterdays
storm. At 8:30 a.m. with a light load (396 lbs. of the English canned meat) we started
for our tent at False Cape Union intending to return at once to our depot at Lincoln
Bay for the last of our provisions which were rather heavy to add and carry in our
load. Reached tent at 12:40 p.m. Started to return at 1 p.m., arrived at Lincoln again at

Temp at 4 p.m.-27.5 Bar. 30.39


## Saturday April 1st 1882

As the season is now advanced so that the influence of the sun can be felt
considerably. Dr. thinks it best to change our time of travel from day to night so that
we may profit by the suns warmth while sleeping and also because the reflection of
the night light an (?) unpleasant effect upon the eyes is not so great. We therefore
decide to lay over till evening and then start (?) but rise early.

Minimum temp during the night -35.0 at 12 p.m. -30, at 4 p.m. 38.8

Dogs irrigated my satchel last night so completely I did not like to handle my sledge
journal which it contained. It was lying on the sledge and being black and glazed
attracted Kingatook’s attention, the other dogs faithfully following his example. We
started north at 6:30 p.m. not expecting to again visit the snowhouse (Lincoln Bay)
until our return homeward. Took “Redeye” along she has not had her pups and her
procrastination makes it appear that she is a malingerer taking advantage of the fact
that she is invalided. She looks as if she were about to present us with a full grown
team of dogs, harnesses and all.

Getting along swimmingly and even congratulating ourselves on the fact that
our work would now be on new ground in a few days, when —in passing from the ice
foot to the Straits at Cape Union (a place safely passed frequently by us) the sledge
bounded awkwardly from the icefoot so that on a lower level and split one runner.
Our consternation was indescribable. It appeared broken beyond al! hope of repait
and the Dr. was completely prostrate. When unloaded and dragged slowly back to the
snowhouse carrying nothing but sleeping bags and cooking gear. The sledge pulled in
its broken state, awkwardly and slowly. Reached snowhouse at about midnight
