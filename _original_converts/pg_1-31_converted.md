## July 7th, 1881 St. John’s NF

This morning the freight for the expedition that arrived per Hibernia was
brought on board the Proteus and every preparation was made for a start — at noon,
Capt. Pike gave the orders to “get under way” — at about 12:30 we move from our
anchorage and amid cheers and the waving of handkerchiefs from the shore, steam
slowly through the narrows. Considerable interest is taken in our departure and it is
with feelings of regret we gaze for the last time for many days upon that most
interesting picture of society and civilized life represented by a group of gaily dressed
ladies who stand on Signal Hill and kindly waved us good by.

Bleak and cold as Newfoundland is with its draping of fog hanging over it’s
high cliffs. We shall exchange it for that desolate land of eternal snow with regret.
Our start is a favorable one as we go coasting along the cold shore
under full sail and steam at a splendid rate. The wind is a pleasant land breeze and
we are carried by the entrance to the great bays Conception and trinity. The ships
crew are busily engaged cleaning up the decks and putting things in their proper
places — “Making things shipshape” as the man says. Our party occupy their time
locating & doffing their city costumes and donning clothes more substantial and
better adapted to ship life. Some are evidently meditating on the future of our arduous
undertaking towards which we have taken our initial step today and which has
probably, in many cases, never been so seriously considered as of this moment.

To realize we have left behind us relatives, friends, society civilization and
everything that makes life pleasant on this terrestrial sphere, for the long space of two
years is enough to furnish ample food for reflection
even to the most thoughtless. And thus it is impossible to avoid looking forwards
with something like apprehension to the future sojourn in those regions of perpetual
snow and ice under a hostile sky. No matter how much forethought may be exercised
these thoughts have never so strongly suggested themselves as at this time when we
find ourselves in the North Atlantic with our ship prow pointed to the North Star and
every revolution of the propeller speeding us nearer our inhospitable destination and
farther from home and friends. We retire at a late hour to be lulled to sleep by the
motion of the ship which has not yet become unpleasant and dream of icebergs and
polar bears.



## July 8, 1881

We are fording along at a splendid rate. The weather is fair but the
temperature is growing much cooler. Now that we are all together a roll call to make
acquaintance (?). We are members of an Arctic exploring expedition sent out under
the auspices of the War Department United States of America. (or more immediately
of the Chief Signal Office USA.) for scientific observation in the Arctic regions. The
plan of the expedition is to establish a station at Lady Franklin Bay. Lat 81° 40’ N and
spend two years in observation and exploration making sledge journey to the North at
such times and season as practicable and formable. The expedition is under the
command of Lieutenant A.W. Greely and the following are various of the persons
accompanying the party.
Lieut. A. W. Greely — in command
Lockwood
Kislingbury
Israel — Astronomer
Gardiner
Jewell — Meteorologist
Ralston
Rice — Photographer
(lists only 8 members of the party)

## July 8, 1881

For our transportation to Lady Franklin Bay the United States Govt. has
chartered the sailing steamer Proteus and are sailing from St. Johns, Newfoundland.
She is commanded by Capt. Pike who has for his First Officer Mr. Norman, Second, .
Mr. White, Mr. McPherson is First Engineer and Mr. Carmichael Second. The crew
is composed of sturdy Newfoundland sailors — Capt. Pike and his mate have all had
long experience in ice navigation and our ship is especially adapted for her mission as
she was built for the seal fishing and everything that experience could suggest was
done to make her capable of resisting the action of the ice.



## July 9th, 1881

There is a strong wind from the NW which makes our progress very slow —
The temperature is getting much cooler. We only make about 5 knots today.


## July 10th, 1881

Our first Sunday ashore — a splendid pleasant day. The wind has changed and
is now in our favor. Wafting us along with the aid of steam at a splendid rate.


## July 11th, 1881

A mild pleasant day until about 4 p.m. when wind hauled ahead and increased
in force so that it now threatens to become a gale. No observation has been made as
weather persists.

## Tuesday July 12th, 1881

The wind still adverse. The temperature has fallen very low and indicates the
presence of ice. At 8 p.m. we fall in with the ice — a long narrow strip of freed ice
through which we cautiously steam at half speed. Following the tortuous channel
which the openings in the ice afford.

The crows nest has been hoisted up to the fore-top-gallant masthead and in it
the Second Mate stands and directs the movement of the ship. The presence of the
ice has calmed the sea and we are surrounded with a most beautiful scene — the
beautiful blue-green edges of the ice blending with the reflections of the setting sun
present a panorama of rare beauty resembling some rare mosaic in a grand scale.

## Tuesday, July 12th

In the foreground can be seen several seals of the harp species. Lt.
Kislingbury hazards several shots at them but without affect as the distance is great.
Occasionally a mammoth whale can be seen emerging like some miniature island
among the ice and water, sending a spout of water which dyed with the tints of the
setting sun, present all the colors of the rainbow. Our position can only be
ascertained by dead reckoning as no meridian observation has been made. We place
this floe of ice in Lat. 61° N.



## Wednesday July 13, 1881

Our party, or those who have been so unfortunate as to be seasick are
recovering their spirits in this water kept smooth by the ice. This Mal de mer has
visited our party pretty frequently without regard to age or station. I am so fortunate
as always to enjoy immunity from it. Lt. Greely has experienced its unpleasant
effects in large degree.

We fell in with another ice pack Lat. About 63° N. It presents the same appearance as
the former pack we met. The wind coming off it makes the temperature very cold
making us realize that we must expect to inhale Boreas’ chilly breath earlier than
anticipated. During our passage the prevailing winds have been from the North which
augers well for our success as the ice will be driven out of Smith Sound admitting of
our passage through it — We sighted land for the first time Friday.

## Thursday, July 14, 1881

We have been in ---since Friday. The sea is calm. A dense fog hangs over
everything. We are compelled to go half speed for fear of encountering bergs which
cannot be distinguished at any distance through the hazy fog.

The Capt. proudly relates an instance of the good Proteus’ ability — While
out on a sealing voyage she had just extricated herself from a pack and had attained
about the rate of half speed when before it could be avoided she ran head on into a
large berg. She actually ran several feet up the side of the berg so great had been the
momentum. She however, sustained no other injury than to destroy her head gear and
neck off the (cutwater). Such accounts of her prowess naturally inspire us with much
confidence. The fog lifts about 1 PM giving us another glimpse of the snow clad
mountains (?) along the seacoast.

## Friday, July 15th, 1881

We can occasionally see the land when the fog lifts. The Capt. and Mr. Israel,
both were successful in getting a meridian observation — our Latitude is 66° 42' N.
Land still in sight. I recognize the land very readily from my remembrance of last


years cruise. To a stranger from the south the weird appearance of these latitudes is
most remarkable and fascinating — a dark, bold striking coastline beyond which the
snow clad mountains ascending to dizzy altitudes can be seen as the gauzy curtain of
the fog lifts. The sea dotted with bergs presents no other obstruction to the eye and as
we again bring our eyes to land we are impressed with the silent and desolate
appearance of land — no sign of animal or vegetable life disturbs or beautifies the
scene. Silence reigns supreme.”

## Saturday, July 16th - 1881

The fog has again settled down this morning and as we are supposed to be in
the latitude of Disco the ships speed is lessened. We are reckoned to be very near
Godhaven
At 2 p.m. and the engines are stopped in a useless attempt to make the lands----to the
dense fog which still prevails. At 8 p.m. to our great delight the fog lifted like some
high curtain rolled back showing the snow clad island of Disco close by.

As the fog dispersed it presented a most beautiful sight — the dark coast
plentifully dotted with glistening bergs — the highland covered with snow, an
occasional streams of ice water trickling it’s way like some silver ribbon over ice and
rocks to the sea below and the fog, like a halo draping the highest peaks. But as we
drew nearer no sign of sunny summer could be seen except a few patches of hardy
grass struggling in favored spots and in the valleys the beautiful green velvety moss
which gives to this land of desolation its name.

## Saturday, July16th 1881

I instantly recognized the conformation of the land from my recollection of
my trip on the Gu/nare last year and was able to direct the way to the Harbor of
Godhavn which we soon reached and dropped anchor about 10p.m. The sun was still
up and the little basin like harbor looked very peaceful and inviting as we steamed
into it.

It was calm and still as a duck pond and in the glassy water, which was clear as
chrystal,
was reflected the towering, frowning cliffs which surround it. The picturesque
Esquimaux in their furry costumes were gliding over the water towards us in their
graceful and fairylike kayaks, and the pantalooned maidens tripped down to the rocks

to get a nearer view of us. It is all so novel and charming that those of us that have
not been here before cannot repress the greatest interest and curiosity in surrounding
so strange and unlike the civilization we have left.

Dr. Pavy and Henry Clay who are expected to join us near Rittenbank distant
about 70 miles. We will leave here in a few days for Rittenbank and will then
precede to Upernavik, our last stopping place until our destination is reached. From
information inspector Smith gives us, we are to infer that our chances of getting
through the ice this year are very good. The winter in Greenland has been a very mild
one and reports from the northern stations state navigation clear of ice.”

## July 17th 1881

This morning we are informed that a boat leaves here for (?) where Danish
ship is lying about ready to start for Copenhagen and will carry our mail matter which
can be sent to us via Denmark. We are all therefore very busily employed writing to
friends and relatives. I send communication to the NY Herald repeating our chances
for getting through to Franklin Bay as well as we can judge from the outlook here.
The day is a very fine one. The bell in the primitive little mission church is calling
the -community to worship. Some of the men attend, Snyder volunteers his services
as organist to the small instrument which stands in the corner of the church. After the
service is over he pleases the Esquamaux much by playing them some lively music
which then attracted a much larger congregation than attended the worship. His music
which was interspersed with an occasional jig and dancing tune was rather un secular
and inappropriate for the Sabbath but we are compelled to admit that the natives were
more pleased with it than with the preceding — moral exercise. I meet the same faces I
saw when here last year. Mr. Smith is still Inspector, Governor Fleisher is Trader and
there have been no maternal changes in the Esqimaux population. They all pleased
with the ship which they consider much strong.

## Monday July 18th, 1881 Monday.

It is difficult for me not noting the time to distinguish night and day here. The
sun does not set until about 11p.m. and is up again at 1 a.m. The morning and evening
twilight blend into one, casting a silver misty light over everything. I am writing this
in the calm at midnight without the aid of artificial light. The crew has been busy all
day shifting the cargo and putting more coals in the bunkers. Our men are bringing
off the lumber that was left by the Gulnare. Also the pemmican stores etc. It has

been too foggy for me to make photographs of Disco and the ship. On the day we
arrived here we noticed a magnificent iceberg near the mouth of the harbor. It was in
the form of an immense arch and presented a very impressive appearance. It was my
intention to return and photograph it at the first opportunity but we had hardly
reached our anchorage before it fell to pieces with a terrific crash louder than thunder.
The sea was disturbed for miles.

## Tuesday July 19th, 1881

I make several negatives today — photograph the Proteus and Godhavn harbor
 — I also make a group of the Governor’s family and Miss Smith and her governess.
They were very much pleased to have the opportunity of being photographed and
dressed themselves for the occasion with great care.” Miss Smith and her companion
looked particularly charming in the bright lively colors of the Danish peasant girl.

At least they look very charming to someone who does not expect to see another
female in a civilized costume for two years —

Lt. Greely purchased a quantity of whale skin for food — it is said to be an
excellent anti-scorbutic and is said to resemble tripe in flavor. It is in a dried state.

He also has contracted for dried fish and walrus meat which is to be the food
of the dogs. We will take in about 14 dogs here and will get others at Rittenbank and
at Upernavik. Inspector Smith and Capt. Fleisher are aiding our commander in every
possible way.

## Wednesday July 20, 1881

Took aboard fourteen dogs, with dog food for their consumption. It consists of
dried fish and walrus meat. The latter is most disagreeable in odor as it is partly
decomposed. But appears to be relished well by the dogs. Getting the animals on
board was a very exciting operation. They offered every resistance and yelped in a
most discordant and disagreeable manner. They are now penned in a small space on
deck where they snarl and snap at one another in the most unfriendly way. Several
encounters between the most warlike of the males has settled the question of
supremacy and now one battle scarred old veteran struts about master of the situation.

We are Ready to start but the fog is too dense to admit of going. Dr. Pavy arrived
from Rittenbank today looking well and relating H. Clay still in Rittenbank in good
health.

## Friday July 22, 1881

Left Rittenback this PM. for Upemavik. Will pass through Waigett, the strait
separating Disco Islands from the mainland.


## Saturday July 23, 1881

On the water — Still in the Waigett. The scenery through the strait is most
magnificent. The land is in sight most of the day. The frowning cliffs rise abruptly
from the sea which calmed by the numerous icebergs is as placid as the waters of
Central Park and reflects back the cliffs and the snow clad mountains behind them.
The stately bergs present the most beautiful feature of the panorama. Immense islands
of ice pure and white as Parian marble awaiting the sculptors chisel although no artist
could give them more beautiful and fantastic forms resembling at times the mosques
and minarets of some oriental city as the midnight sun dyes them with glorious tints.
The base is generally marked with a beautiful green where the dark blue water washes
over it.

## Sunday July 24th, 1881

Left Disco this morning at 2 a.m. and after a run of about sixty miles along the
coast of Disco islands arrived in Rittenbank an were welcomed by a salute of three
guns from the battery in front of the governors residence. Mr. Clay came aboard
looking worse the wear for his months in the arctic. Lt. Lockwood with a small party
visited the loonery seven miles from here and brought back 70 birds, principally the
small Auk. He reports great numbers of birds and a great many were shot that could
not be picked up on account of their inaccessible position on the high cliffs. A great
many eggs were destroyed by the birds dragging them off in their fall from their nests
on the shelving rocks.
We have taken seven dogs in addition to those already procured. Also, about two tons
of the dried fish for food Dr. Pavy and H. Clay are busy getting their effects on board.
Arrived at Upernavik this morning at 5:30. The Latitude of this place is 72
48° W. it resembles the other Danish settlements we have visited. Consists of the
residence of the Governor, the storehouse, Coopers shop, Smithy and the Inuit huts of
the Esquimaux population. Gen. Elberg has received us very graciously and
expressed his willingness to aid the expedition all he can. The Inspectors of North
Greenland when we were at Disco is also here temporarily on his tour of inspection.
We shall take on more dogs here, also skins and skin clothing.


## Monday July 25,1881

It is storming hard today and a party that was to leave for Provan did not start.
The dogs have been landed on a small rock near the harbor that they may get some
exercise— Expect to leave here about five days.

## Tuesday July 26, 1881

A party (Lt. Lockwood, Gov. Elberg of U, Cross, Linn and myself) started this
morning for Proven to procure two Esquimaux to accompany the expedition as dog
drivers and hunters. The distance is about 50 miles. We took the inside passage
through the islands as the sea was too rough to go outside. Our conveyance was the
little steam launch “Lady Greely”. The scenery in the channels and fiords through
which we passed was most remarkable and in the same grand and impressive scale as
that of the Waigtt . Some of the passages were so narrow that at first sight it
appeared impossible to get through them. But a nearer approach proved them to be as
deep as mid ocean; the walls of the adamantine cliffs descend perpendicular to a great
depth. Nothing but rock appears and that is evidently of volcanic formation.
Occasionally a little carpeting of beautiful green moss covers the evidence of nature’s
convulsions and is the only representative of the vegetable kingdom that we can see.
We are at Proven at 9:30 p.m.

## Wednesday, July 27, 1881
At  Proven a better opportunity for studying the habits of the primitive
aborigines, is afforded than at any other place we have visited. The whalers and the
exploring parties seldom get there so the influence of the white man is less
perceptible. They retain their habits of life as practiced before the white man

improved their condition in other parts of Greenland. I spent at least three hours in
one of the most uninviting (gloots?) or huts I saw. The manufacture of a cap of eider
down for which I was waiting gave me a pretext for the long stay. The hut was built
of (?) rocks and moss and was entered of a long tunnel so low that I was compelled
to crawl on my hands and feet to affect an entrance, a most disagreeable and
humiliating proceeding as the dogs and natives, not much better than the former in
point of cleanliness, enter in the same way. On reaching the small interior hole,
which is at once their living quarters, eating and sleeping room, I was surprised to see
the mistress of the housed in a state of almost complete nudity sitting on the shelf or
platform on which they sleep. I turned aside to give her an opportunity of donning
more complete costume,
(Con’t.)

but a furtive backward glance soon showed me that she appeared to prefer
being dressed as nearly A la (?) as possible. I at once face the music and had some
made a satisfactory arrangement by which I was to receive a ice cap in exchange for a
neckerchief I wore. The former, however was not in issue so the contract remained
executory (sic) until it was completed.

The maker measured the dome of my intended with great precision and was
intensely employed in cutting up Eider skin and fitting them with a cap. Her
scantiness of clothes appeared to give her an advantage as she seemed to get along
more expeditiously by holding the skin between her feet while sewing.

The room was very low and the atmosphere stifling and nauseating from the
odors exhaled by the skins and oil — no glass in the windows, as a substitute they used
the membranous tissue of the stomach of the seal which when oiled is almost
transparent. There was no stove or fireplace instead they used a hollow stone for a
lamp with fuel oil and moss for a wick. The floor was of stone and earth. The
sleeping arrangements
(con’t.)

were very simple, a platform about two feet high extending from the wall and
occupies one side of the room. This is the receptacle of skins and (?) during the day
and when the natives retire they make a (?) couch each disciple of morphea drawing
over him or herself as many of the skins as necessary for comfort. The costume of the
Esquimaux women is so nearly like that of the Inuit that at first sight is not easy to
distinguish the (?) although the former make theirs up in a much more elaborate

manner(-----------------) Their feet are encased in a pair of dainty boots
reaching - (?) at the knee, next came the pants or trunks which however are very short
coming down, not more than half way of the thighs. The parts arte pulled up to meet
them. The upper part of the body is covered by a cassock of sealskin devoid of
buttons and pulled on over the head. An attached hood can be drawn over the head or
allowed to fall back on the shoulders at pleasure. My cap being complete, I was glad
to get away from the nauseating surroundings and into the fresh air again. Many of
the natives from here occupy much better dwellings than the one I have described. -
such as one represents the habitations of the poorer class who have not ..... with the
Danes. In the (?) I entered a large building occupied by a half
(missing sentence) need and finding an old violin on the wall I soon had a
number of the fair sex dancing enthusiastically to my rather imperfect music. I
became very popular with them at once and in leaving Proven which we did at 10:30
p.m. a bevy of dark maidens were at the shore to bid me ‘goodby’ or their Esquimaux
equivalent. Through the efforts of Gov. Elberg the two Esquimaux, Christiansen and
Edwards were induced to accompany us. They exhibited considerable emotion
prying themselves away unlike their stoic North American relatives. On parting with
their friends they shed bitter tears that fell indeed until their homes were out of sight.

We had a very pleasant passage returning. The Midnight Sun making it light
as day. We shot 130 loons or at least we recorded that many. Large numbers
remaining dead on the cliffs inaccessible to us. The females were sitting in rows
incubating and when shot the eggs would roll off and come crashing down the rocks
in thousands turning the water yellow. The two natives were in their element darting
about in their graceful kayaks picking up the dead birds.

## Thursday July 28, 1881

We arrived in Upernavik reaching (?) at about 10:30 a.m. Found Proteus
about ready to start. Took dogs on board, their number 11 now increased to thirty
from former and three pups. I am busy the remaining part of the day in photographing
the inspector, the Gov’s children and in getting my things packed away before
starting to sea again.


## Friday, July 29, 1881

We left Upernavik today at 4:30 p.m. All hands were busy in writing letters
before starting to go by the Danish ship which was soon to leave Greenland for
Copenhagen. I sent letter to Herald.

Inspector and Gov. Elberg came and bade us farewell not leaving the ship
until we had passed out of the harbor. I made photographs at Provan.


## Saturday, July 30, 1881

We found very little ice. It has been the experience of almost all Arctic
voyages to fall in with the pack after leaving Upernavik. Our departure from
Upernavik furnished us with material for reflection. It is the last point at which the
least semblance of civilization can be found — the course now leads into that vague
unknown region which is so indefinitely marked out to be undefined. Our ship now
ploughs waters that have seldom been disturbed. No sails whiten the broad expanse
of dark blue water. In their stead the stately bergs stalk majestically along. We can
scarcely refrain from descanting in the beauties of the latter whenever the subject is
suggested. To think of them only as miniature islands of ice conveys no idea of their
remarkable beauty — when lighted up by the peculiar rays of the midnight sun. I shall
refer to them again later.

## July 30, 1881

Today when in Latitude 74° 30’N considerable excitement was occasioned by
the discovery of a veritable Polar bear. We had steamed into a small pack of ice
extending in a narrow inlet and his bearship was seen on one of the pieces of ice
enjoying an evening meal of a seal he had caught. A bear! A bear! was shouted in
excited tones all over the ship and soon our hunters were seen emerging with their
rifles. The bear a few hundred yards from the ship and among a number of shots fired,
one or two bullets hit him. — up to this time he had been perfectly indifferent to our
approach not finding it disagreeable for him. He went in to the water and swan a
distance emerging to crawl in the ice again — by this time Kislingbury and Lockwood
with Mr. Clay rowed nearer to him and soon dispatched him, bringing him
triumphantly aboard. He was soon enthusiastically hoisted on board and as soon as he
could be placed in position I proceeded to make

(cont.)

a photograph of him. It was a young male in good condition. Our two Esquimaux
were in their element dressing the carcass and soon had it hanging.


## Sunday July 31, 1881

We are making very good progress North though it is considered strange that
no large packs of ice have been met. We fell in today with a small pack. Several seals
of the “square flipper” kind were seen on the ice and we succeeded in shooting one I
also photographed it. The bear meat which we had for breakfast proved quite
palatable although a little fishy, but the ducks rather reconciled us to that taste and the
bear was not more fishy than they. Our fare will be still more varied by the meat of
the seal which is considered excellent.

## Monday, August 1st 1881

The fog has been settling down here. Fortunately cleared away by the time
we saw Cape Dudley Diggs. We soon after made the Carey Islands and the Proteus
stood in to the land remaining about three hours. A large party of us landed. The
Cairn erected by Capt. Allan Young was examined and a record found which we
brought away leaving a copy to which Lt. Greely added a short account of our own
progress. A letter addressed to Sir George Nares was also found. While we were at
the cairn another division of our party formed and examined the cache of stores or
rations left by Sir George Haines. They were found in good condition. The rum was
tested and found excellent. Several cans of the meat was brought on board and
appeared to be as good as when deposited there six years ago. The biscuit was
however moldy in part — probably one fourth of it being spoiled.

## Tuesday, Aug 2, 1881

This morning we had the pleasure of sighting Cape Alexander at entrance to
Smith Sound we soon steaed by passing the celebrated Chrystal (sic) Palace Glacier
and Chrystal Palace cliffs. Cape Alexander in Lat 78° 10’N and is considered the key
to the unknown Arctic. Considerable exultation was felt.

"We are within 8 degrees of the Pole”, says Lt. Greely — If we never get any
nearer.” We soon passed Port Foulke — Dr. Hayes winter quarters and anchored

about near by Lyttleton (sic) Island. Capt Allen Young in the ‘Pandora’ left letters
here for the Alert and Discovery which were never recovered by the latter ships as
they were on their way home and were south of this place when Capt Young
departed. It was also about this place that the ill starred Polaris was lost and on the
mainland the party under Captain Buddington mutinied — so we had abundant interest
in
(cont)

going ashore here. One party under Lt.Greely went to Cove for the bag of letters and
another with Lt. Kislingbury to find the Polaris quarters — or what remained — to the
latter I attached myself taking my photographic apparatus along — after a row of
about 2 miles we entered Lifeboat Cove and after tramping around discovered a
demolished cairn, probably by the Indians, and broken scientific instrument including
a transit, strewn about. Further on we found remains of their quarters — stoves, nails,
locks, instruments, etc. etc. The time passed very quickly as we handled and looked
over the articles so unceremoniously left behind when the Ravenscraig brought the
storm tossed party such a happy delivery. I photographed the sited also made a few
of Lifeboat Cove. An adventure awaited us on our return. While paddling across
Lifeboat Cove a school of walruses were seen disporting themselves in the water.
We cautiously approached them and soon a well directed bullet was lodged in
the neck of a large female. The herd deserted her and her calf emitting the most
piteous sound was seen crawling on the neck of the mother. The water was dyed
with blood. Clay succeeded in hitting the calf and no doubt killed it — as it sank at
once an did not rise again. The mother dove but soon came up again and again
struck. She now came directly for the boat. With evident warlike intentions. Waiting
until she was within twenty feet of the boat Lt. K and Clay fired simultaneously, the
two bullets rattling in her open mouth down her throat. We waited for her to rise
again but nothing more was seen of her. I have no doubt that both the mother and the
calf were killed as they always sink when shot. A harpoon is required to save them.

We found Lt. Greely and his party on shore. They shortly after came in
loaded with kegs and boxes of letters and pemmican that had been left for the Nares
party. Lt. G. will send then by the to go to England via Newfoundland.


## Wednesday August 3rd, 1881

Lyttleton Island is in Lat 78° 23” N, long. 73° 30°W. Left there last night and
was surprised and more than pleased to find open water. A most beautiful morning —
the sea calm as a duck pond reflecting back the dark cliffs with unmistakable
distinctiveness. Photographed Bache Island at a distance of 20 miles from the ship —
Also photographed Cape Hawks and Washington Irving Island at a distance of 8
miles. These photographs on account of the great distance and remarkable reflection
fogging the plates and disadvantage of making them from the ship while in motion,
are not very good negatives. But were fine for geographical purposes. — While Lt.
Greely was ashore examining the depot left at Cape Hawks (where we arrived at 8:30
a.m.), I was landed on piece of floe ice and from that position made photographs of
the surrounding land, Cape Hawks and Washington Irving Island. Lt. Greely found
boat and stores which were brought aboard — left Cape Hawks at 11 a.m.

## August 4th, 1881

We are having a most remarkable run. No obstructions are met with. These
waters so difficult of navigation are as clear as can be wished for. We Passed Cape
Fraser at 2;50 p.m. having accomplished in sixteen hours the distance from Lyttleton
Island that occupied the English expedition twenty one days to make. The experience
of all who passed up Smith Sound has been that the passage is difficult to make and
nothing but the most untiring and energetic warfare with the ice will enable any ship
to pass and then only when the season is favorable. Our experience is without
precedent and cannot be accounted for. Passed Cape Constitution, mountains highest
and now at 9:40 p.m. after several delays on account of fog and detours to avoid ice
we meet the main pack — solid and forbidding — The ice appears solid and densely
packed, no channels or openings with
Capes Lieber and Baird on the side and Thank God Harbor and the celebrated
Petermann Fiord on the other, only 10 miles from our destination. We are as
completely cut off from it as if this ice had met us at a lower latitude. After steaming
around to see if any opening presented the ice, anchors were brought out and the old
Proteus made fast to the ice to await further developments. Latitude 81°36’ N


The pack appears to be very compact and shows no signs of breaking up — at
4:30 p.m. part of the edge ice on fringe which appears to be thinner than the main —
breaks up. We left in morning, go amid large pieces, in shots moving down and ran to
the west and fastened in ice again at 7 p.m. — at 7:30 ice compelled us to make
another small change. The fog is alternatively lifting and settling down upon us.


## Saturday August 6th, 1881

A beautiful day, calm and clear. The water as glassy as Fairmount Park — I
photograph ice, Cape Lieber and surroundings — Narwhals and white whales were
seen. The Esquimaux succeeded in fastening to one of the fish, but it escaped by
going under the ice and breaking off the string of harpoons.

## Sunday August 7th, 1881

At 3:30 a.m. tried to force ship through channel in ice but the attempt was
ineffectual. Fastened to the floe again not shifting till 3 p.m. when we moved to the
Southward. Unless the ice will break-up and leave us a channel we shall be forced too
far to enable us to reach Lady Franklin Bay this season and be compelled to seek
winter quarters on a lower latitude. I am apprehensive that we will be caught in the
pack and held firmly. The pack as it moves taking us down Smith Sound as it did the
Polaris. The outcome is rather disconcerting when we consider how nearly we
attained out destination. To be forced back now after getting a sight of our goal will
be a greater disappointment than the same results if the difficulty had been met
earlier.

## Monday August 8th, 1881

Strong northerly current. New ice formed in the small ponds in the pack at
temp 30° F 1 1/4” in thickness. We are still drifting south — at 11 p.m. off Cape de
Fosse.


## Tuesday August 9th, 1881

Made steam at 12:15 a.m. going north. Made fast to ice again at 1 a.m. At 4
a.m. the ice apparently closing in about us. Were therefore compelled to steam Smith
Sound and get in more open water. 10 a.m. tracking Smith again on account of ice. In
face the ice appears determined to drive us in a more southerly position. It now looks
as if our chances of reaching Discovery Harbor this season are not very good. 11 p.m.
moved west.

## Wednesday, August 10th, 1881

Vessel is still being carried to the south — a strong current from the north has
been perceived. We can now see Franklin Island through the fog. Little by little the
ice is forcing us back. If the main pack should start in a body we would instantly be
carried with it to the S and compelled no doubt to winter at a lower point. After being
so near our destination to be compelled to establish our winter quarters at a lower
Latitude will be a great disappointment.

## Thursday, Aug 11th, 1881

Underway at 3 a.m. Ice ahead appears moving from the west shore. Made fast
to ice again at 4:10 p.m. The ice ahead appears to be moving and ship starts again.
Hope again is to posses some of us — The man in the crows nest reports open water.
As we draw nearer the way appeard open to Discovery Harbour. No ice in sufficient
quantities to offer any obstruction to Lady Franklin Bay. Capes Lieber and Baird
soon passes and at 2 p.m. we were inside the breakwater of Dutch Island. Discovery
Harbro is filled with ice but the stout Proteus can evidently force a passage for
herself. Several hours were spent running with the ice. Each successive charge sending 
her farther into the harbor. As the question of our establishing our quarters
here or nearer the cole-mine four miles distant was not settled, the ship was allowed
to remain quiet until a visit to the coal mine and a knowledge of our prospects should
decide the matter. On entering the the harbor the Boatswain (Mr. White) discovered a
Musk Ox on the side of the hill. Mr. White went ashore, soon a well directed shot
brought him rolling down the cliffs. This started our hunters and after a few hours,
Lt. Lockwood, Clay and Ryan who formed the part, brought back the report that
they had killed 10. Lt. Lockwood and Mr. Clay then started for the coal mine, and on


their way killed 3 more, making 14 muskoxen killed first day. I photographed ship in
ice.

## Friday August 12th, 1881

Lt. Lockwood having brought back information that the harbor near the coal
mine was not accessible and the position for establishing our camp not so favorable as
near Discovery Harbor. Lt. Greely concludes to establish quarters at the latter place.
The ship is then forced through the ice further into the harbor. A difficult task
occupying the time till 2 p.m. She would charge the ice at full speed sending her hull
half it’s length in the ice where she would be sometimes stuck. But extricating
herself would back out and return to the charge. At one time it was necessary to blast
the ice out from under to free her. Preparations are speedily being made for loading
our goods and stores. The cairn left by the English to be examined and their records
read. The cairn is a monument to determination for it is built of hundreds of empty
cans filled with pebbles. I photographed the musk oxen as they lay dead.

## Saturday August 13th, 1881

We were busily engaged today discharging cargo — I gave some assistance to
the Signal Observers in making up their meteorological reports which Lt. Greely
intends sending back by the Proteus.


## Sunday Aug 14th, 1881

From above date till Sunday, August 22nd no important occurrence has taken
place. I have been so busily engaged that it seems impossible to give any time to my
diary. The weather was uniformly pleasant with the exception of Wednesday 18th
when at evening some snow fell. On the eve of the18th Proteus ready to start as all
cargo was discharged, but the weather being bad, Capt. Pike decided to remain at
anchor until 4 a.m. The majority of party transferred their chattels ashore and erected
tents. I remained on board finishing letters and did not leave the ship until she was
underway.

During the past week I have been making photographs daily at our camp as it
increased in size and the house as it assumed from day to day the appearance of a
human habitation. The negatives are sent to the Signals Office and will serve to show
the progress we are making and also the general appearance of the locality. I was kept


excessively engaged writing my letters up to that time and snatching a few hours
sleep before breakfast. Many letters to write as no other opportunity may be offered
for years. At least one year, and the experience of this season rather shakes my belief
in the ability of a ship to reach this latitude every season. It is a mere chance. I made
most of the negative at midnight,
writing my letters up to that time and snatching a few hours of sleep before breakfast.
The working party has been divided into two groups — one working while the other
slept. In this way the work was going on all the time. Of course night offered no
disadvantages; the sun was above the horizon during the twenty four hours. I was able
to make photographs at any hour of the night.

On the morning of the 19th, 4 a.m. after finishing my letters and making out
dispatch for New York Herald, I went ashore. It was snowing hard. Borrowed a
sleeping bag from Dr. Pavy, and finding that Jewell and Israel occupied a larger tent
than was necessary for their accommodation I was soon comfortably ensconced
inside their tent.

The Proteus did not succeed in getting very far, just outside the breakwater at Bellot
Island. The ice had packed in as firmly to admit of their passing.

On 21st Ryan was taken with an epileptic fit and it was decided to send him home -
this makes the second man sent back for physical disability. Starr, the other man,
showed asthmatic tendencies.

## Monday, August 22nd, 1881

Light snow fell. The dogs are still dying off. Dr. Payve with the aid of
Esquimaux Jens and Frederick is doing all that is possible to save them. Sulphur was
administered.
Dr. Myself and the Esquimaux made a second trip to Water Course Bay after
the two carcasses of musk oxen. Took tent poles along and tied the meat up. Found
the foxes had devoured some of the meat (see private journal this date)


## Tuesday, August 23rd 1881

Still busily engaged on the house. I am compelled to rest for a couple of days
to recover from a strain I gave myself in the lifting the muskoxen at Water Course
Bay.



## Wednesday, August 24th, 1881

Our house is so nearly completed that most of the party have deserted their
tents and moved into the house. I still remain in the tent, as I anticipate that life in the
house will be so monotonous during the long dark winter that the longer I camp out
the better as the change will be more agreeable

## August 25th, 1881

My tentmates Jewell and Israel today transferred themselves to the house. I
am left the sole occupant of the tent. I find it rather cool, but there is much comfort
and pleasure in crawling into a warm deerskin sleeping bag. I find reading a pleasant
occupation, although the conditions are entirely different from those under which this
recreation is generally indulged in. After shooting myself as a sword into the fur
scabbard of my sleeping bag, I draw the bag up under my chin and putting on cap and
mittens enjoy myself with Dickens or the less enjoyable, but more instructive legal
works of Kelent: A sense of comfort is experienced not withstanding the fact that the
snow can be heard whirling against the canvas of the tent. And this is August. Today
the “Proteus” heretofore unable to get away, succeeded in getting through the ice and
passed out of sight. We cannot know of course what her success will be in getting out
of Smith Sound until next year. Lt. Kislingbury on account of some dissatisfaction
with the commanders management desired to go back. Permission was granted and he
prepared to return by the Proteus, but before he could reach her, she passed out and
he was compelled to remain.

## August 26th, 1881

A severe snow storm set in during last night, it snowed all day Friday. I spent
most of the time in sleeping bag reading The work on the house could only be carried
on inside and afforded opportunities for but few of our number to work at the same
time.


## Saturday August 27th, 1881

The snow continued to fall at intervals today.


## Sunday August 28th, 1881

Cleared up.



## Monday, August 29th, 1881

The Dr. and I were busy making preparations for a pedestrian trip to
Lincoln Bay to examine the depot of provisions left by the English Expdn of '75-76.
We started at 7P.M. on our trip carrying a small tent, blankets, cooking apparatus
 alcohol and rations. Ralston and Linn accompanied us as far as St Patrick's Bay at 1 a.m. on 
the 30th and camped all night. The weather was extremely cold. The thermometer was
down to zero.

## Tuesday, August 30th, 1881

The fog was so dense in the morning that we did not attempt to travel as we
were uncertain which of two routes to take and could not decide until a view was
afforded.

The fog cleared up and we started from camp at 2 p.m. Traveled over very rough
country and at 3 p.m. commenced descending the mountain side to the stream running
into St. Patrick’s Bay, a most difficult task as the ground was rough and rocky and the
decline very steep. Observed a strongly marked fog 4 p.m. It contained all the
colors of the rainbow. We passed the stream at 6 p.m. and after ascending the hill on
the other side we continued until we had traveled 10 hours, where we camp at 12
midnight in the neighborhood of Cape Beechy. We were compelled to sup on frozen
preserve of meat and biscuit. With our alcohol lamp we melted enough snow to
quench our thirst. The minimum thermometer registered +5 during the night.

## Wednesday, August 31st, 1881

We packed up, and made another start at 11:30a.m. We were compelled to make
another difficult descent to the ravine at Cape Beechy. I saw numerous tracks of
muskoxen and following them fell in with a herd of nine muskoxen. While the Dr.
was engaged in making a cache of some of our rations for use on our return, I made a
detour around one of the hills and attempted a shot at them with the large Colt
revolver. I aimed but with without any result. They scampered off in a remarkably active
manner considering their clumsy appearance. Their hair is very long and hangs from
their belly nearly to the ground giving them an extemeley short legged appearance,
but their agility can not be questioned as they will climb up the sides of an almost


perpendicular cliff without difficulty. We render our way to the shore and attempted
to reach Wrangel Bay by the ice foot. We only reached the “Blade Cliffs” where we
found the ice foot completely washed away and the cliffs descending almost
perpendicular to the water. It was impossible to span, or to climb up to the plateau or
top of mountain. We were compelled to retrace out steps and camped at foot of ravine
at 1:30 a.m. Sept 1st

## Thursday, September 1st, 1881

The ravine at the foot at which we camped appeared to afford us a means of
reaching the mountain top above and traveling overland to Wrangel Bay. Broke
camp at 1:30 a.m. and made the difficult ascent to the top of the mountain. Our
progress was slow and difficult. Aneroid Bar. indicated height of cliffs 2,500 feet.
We found a strong breeze blowing with drifting snow. Our progress was now most
difficult. The temperature was a few degrees below zero, the wind blew fiercely
sending the blinding snow into our faces. Our breaths condensed and froze on our
beards until the weight of the ice pulling the hair was painful. It was impossible to
stop to eat or rest as no shelter was afforded. Reached Wrangel Bay at midnight and
the first warm meal. We had traveled twelve hours and had eaten nothing but two
biscuits each. We suffered very much of thirst and found that eating the frosty snow
gave but little relief.

The pleasure it gave us to find water in our camp at Wrangel Bay can only be
imagined. We had to cut through a foot of ice to reach it. Found traces of muskoxen
at Wrangel Bay.

## Friday, September 2, 1881

Left camp at 11:30 a.m. The temperature during the night was low. Our boots
were frozen stiff and in placing a small canteen of rum to my lips it stuck instantly to
them and in removing it the skin was taken off in places. Our socks generally got wet
during the day and we would place one pair between our shirts at night where they
were dry by the heat of the body. We now took to the icefoot and experienced much
difficulty in places where the heavy ice has crowed and piled on the shore. I
attempted to pass on new ice that had been formed during probably, our [] thaw two
nights. I fell through in one place and got wet up to my waist. My boots were filled
with water. I emptied them and rung the water out of my socks.” The boots retained


so much of the water that I had wet feet all of the rest of the day. We reached Cape
Frederick VII at 9 p.m. were forced to follow the shore of Lincoln Bay arrived to the
north side where the depot of rations was placed. Through a mistake we pass them
and finding ourselves out of the bay concluded to proceed a little further to Cape
Union instead of doing so the following day as we had intended. The distance was
greater than we supposed and by the time we were able to get back to Lincoln Bay
after reaching Cape Union it was 10 a.m. on the 3rd. I was the first to find the depot
and after a walk of 22 1/2 continuous hours with nothing to eat but a cup of chocolate
and two biscuits, the cache of provisions was a pleasant sight.

We, notwithstanding our fatigue spent a few hours looking over the
provisions. We went into camp at 1 p.m. of 3rd.
We spent the day in examining the provisions, 1000 rations were left by the
English and we found them after a lapse of six years in general good conditions. The
bread was all spoiled as the barrels had shrunk and water had entered, but chocolate,
preserved meat, stearine, etc. were as good apparently as when deposited. The barrel
of rum was two thirds full. Some of the tobacco tea and sugar was injured, but the
greatest part was still good.

I was extremely lame all day, my feet and joints of the legs swollen, but did
not (know) the true cause of it until later. I suffered it the simple stiffness from the
long walk and exposure, but the acute rheumatism had attacked me. I made every
effort to overcome the difficulty as I attended to the stiffness induced by long
traveling without rest but I found to be impossible, however, at 6 p.m. we started.
Our progress was very slow as I suffered excruciatingly at every step. We had not
traveled far before we met a large Arctic hare which I succeeded in shooting with the
revolver I carried. It was a beautiful animal with its fur as white as snow, the tips of
the ears black. The Dr., with a naturalist's enthusiasm proceeded at once to add it to 
his load although I attempted to dissuade him on account of the already oppressive
weight of our loads. I could not think of adding more to mine.

## September 5, 1881

After leaving the depot at Lincoln Bay yesterday evening we crossed the bay,
on reaching the other side the Dr. followed the icefoot while I kept out on the ice in
bay. The Dr. had the best traveling and had to wait until I caught up to him. We then


plotted along for sixteen hours reaching Wrangel Bay at 10 a.m. today. We pitched
our tent and attempted to get water from the brook that supplied us when traveling the
oWber way, but the frost had dried it up and we were compelled to melt snow. I cannot
discuss my suffering in reaching this point. The acute rheumatism attacking my legs
and arms made every step extremely painful to me. As the malady is always
accompanied by fever I felt parched and thirst all the time, and water was a scarce as
in the desert of the Sahara. I was cruelly disappointed several times after cutting 18
inches of ice to what I supposed was a pool of fresh water in the ice foot to find the
water either salt or dried up.

At 6 p.m. we started again. I was so sick I had to be helped to my feet and could walk
but slowly. The rheumatism had attacked my body so that breathing was difficult and
painful. Reached Cape Beechey and camped at lakes 3 p.m. of 6th.

## Tuesday September 6, 1881

Started again at 9 p.m. I was suffering terribly. Dr. Pavy found my pulse up to
114. I desired that the Dr. to leave me and go on in advance so that I might rest my
terribly swollen legs and follow him as soon as I could. He would not hear of such an
arrangement. He then transferred almost all of my load to his pack leaving me only
the tent to carry. After going a short distance he concluded to abandon the rabbit and
other supplies articles such as cartridges, etc. Our progress was necessarily slow. The
rheumatism in the muscle of the chest caused me to groan with every respiration. My
limbs were terribly pained also —. Nothing but the greatest exercise of will enabled
me to move at all. On several occasions thought of giving up let the consequences be
what they might. We reached the small cache of provisions we had left in the ravine
between Beechy and St. Patrick’s Bay at 9 a.m. on the 7th. We prepared a meal and
quenched our thirst. Erected our shelter tent and attempted to rest but the pain
racking my limbs made sleep impossible.

## Wednesday, September 7, 1881

At 8 p.m. we attempted to start, but it was an impossibility with me. Dr. P
tried to encourage me to get as far as St. Patrick’s Bay so that he could get from there
to Station and send a party out for me. I was as sensible of the importance of
proceeding as he was but for me to move was absolutely impossible. We made a
compromise, however. I promised him to start the following morning. If it was still


impossible he was to proceed to the home station and return with or send out party for
me.


## Thursday, September 8, 1881 

Started on our journey again 7 a.m. It is unnecessary to describe my
suffering. Although the distance to St. Patrick's Bay was short we were tramping
until 10 p.m. before we reached the valley above the bay. I could hardly move. The
Dr. preceded me as we neared the campling place and succeeded in finding water
before I arrived. I laid down on the ground and he erected the camp over me. I could
not move. He was compelled to leave me and start for camp.

## Friday, September 9th, 1881 

The Dr. reached the station home at 3 a.m. and on reporting our condition a
party made preparations to go to my assistance. Out of a large number of volunteers
five were considered a sufficient number. They were preceded by Sgt. Brainard who
reached me at 10 a.m. He brought with him a bottle of wine, warm rolls and soon
prepared for me a good cup of chocolate. Although I had fasted so long I had no 
appetite. The wine however was very pleasant as | suffered much from thirst. At 12
p.m. the four men who followed Brainard arrived. They had brought a litter or ladder
which served as one. I was placed on it and carried about four miles where the
mountain afforded an easier ascent. The ascent was very steep and rough and an
ineffectual attempt to carry me up decided Sgt. Brainard in sending for more help.
Bender started for camp and five volunteers at once started. Meantime the first party
were doing all they could for my comfort. An alcohol lamp was kept burning in the
shelter tent which they had again erected over me again. Their own discomfort was
considerable. The thermometer was below zero and they were compelled to walk to
and fro to keep warm. The tent was too small to afford them shelter. I could not
move hand or foot. At 8:30 p.m. the additional party arrived and with much difficulty
they succeeded in carrying me up the hill where they placed me on a sledge and
hauled me to the station where we arrived at 2 a.m. Sept 10th.

## Saturday, September 10, 1881

After being placed in bed this morning I began to improve. I had before
leaving rested in sleeping bag in my tent but Gardiner had kindly arranged a cot for



me me the quarters. The relief party who brought me in here, very much exhausted.
Whistler (sic) had his foot frozen. I have learned that Lt. Lockwood found on
arriving at station that his foot was badly frozen the day we met him as we started out
Aug 29th.


## Sunday, September 11, 1881

Lt. Lockwood and Gardiner accompanied by the Esquimaux Frederich with
dog sledge started to explore the Bellot Valley. Sunday service in the morning — Rum
issued in the evening.

I learn that during my absence ten, 10, muskoxen were killed at the “Bellows”
about 13 miles from station. A sled and wagon abandoned by the English Expdn of
‘75 were also found. Also the open water encouraged Lt. Greely to send party under
Sgt. Brainard to Cape Beechy with whale boat to establish a depot of provisions to be
used by sledge parties traveling north this fall. They encountered great difficulties.
The moving ice continually threatened to crush the boat.

## Monday September 12, 1881

Sgt. Brainard’s party however, succeeded in reaching Cape Beechy after
fifteen tiresome and dangerous hours at the oars. They found it impossible to return
with the boat as the ice closed up the passage completely. They returned by land.
They started from Station 31st August and returned Sept 3rd. Today Brainard and
Cross make a trip to Hogback. They use snowshoes. I am improving rapidly


## Tuesday September 13, 1881

The carpenters are busily engaged in finishing the ceiling of quarters.
Lt. Lockwood and Gardiner return at 8:30 p.m.


## Wednesday, September 14, 1881

The weather continues fine. The inner walls of quarters completed today.

## Thursday September 15, 1881

Dr. Pavy and Whistler with Eskimo Jens and two sledges and teams start out
to examine Archers Fiord and English caches supposed to be in that direction. They
had only proceeded a short distance on the ice when a pack of nineteen wolves were


seen on the ice. Several nimrods attempted to get near enough for a shot the but
wolves were too wary and left the ice, following the ravine to the northward.
Whistler came back for a rifle and ammunition. The strong force of wolves rather
alarmed the Dr.


## Friday, September 16, 1881

Lt. Greely with Brainard and Bender started out to visit the United States
Range of mountains. Connell was to accompany them one day's march to assist in
carrying the outfit, etc. Lt. Greely returns at 3 p.m. His knee goes out and Connell
went on instead.

Henry and I set poisoned meat for the wolves in the valley near Mt. Cartnell. This is
my first trip from camp since my return. The wolves have completely shredded the
hides and cleaned the heads of the dead muskoxen.

## Saturday, September 17, 1881

The snow fell all day today. The commanding officer has given out that on
the birthday of each member of the party a celebration of the event shall take place to
such as the circumstances will permit. The member who’s birthday is celebrated shall
on that day be exempt from all duty and shall have the privilege of making out the bill
of fare for the dinner which will be the grand event of the day. In the evening a quart
of rum is to be issued. Today is Whistlers birthday and he inaugurates the system.


## Sunday September 18,1881

Lt. Greely reads a chapter from the Bible aloud to us every Sunday moming.
This with a prayer read for those who desire, comprising our religious services.
Brainard and party return at 8 P.M. They did not reach the United States Range.

## Monday September19, 1881

Jewell’s birthday. He makes out a bill of fare which furnishes us with a grand
dinner considering our distance from market. The temperature very cold for this
season of the year. The thermometer registered -10, 42 degrees below the freezing
point. Rather cold weather for Indian summer.



## Tuesday September 20, 1881

Dr with Linn and Jewell attempt to Carry rations to Cape to be cached there
for the use of the party which is expected to go to Cape Joseph Henry later in the
season. They get to Distant Cape when they find open water and the ice foot being
rough and much obstructed, the Dr. decided to leave the rations there until later when
the ice shall have formed. On the return of the party Lt. Greely decides to make an
attempt himself as he considers the difficulty not sufficient to deter a party from
getting around Distant Cape. He was over yesterday and examined the ground. Lt G.
selects Brainard and I to assist him. We start at 1 p.m. with dogs and sledges.
Frederick the Esquimaux is our driver. With great difficulty we succeeded in getting
almost to Watercourse Bay when one sledge broke down and we were obliged to
return.

## Wednesday Sept 21, 1881

This morning, the sledge having been repaired, Brainard, Linn and I start to
complete the work commenced yesterday. Having noticed several floebergs that
would make good subjects for pictures, I took my photographic apparatus along. Left
it at Distant Cape as I did not wish to risk it on the other sledge over the rough
icefoot. After assisting Brainard over the most difficult of the way, I left them at the
entrance of Watercourse Bay, and returned for the photo outfit. By the time I again
reached Watercourse Bay where the most striking bergs were, it had commenced
snowing and I had succeeded in getting but indifferent light on the subjects. I exposed
the plates and leaving the apparatus to be brought in by the sledge I returned to the
quarters overland reaching camp at 6 p.m. On arriving I learned that the large
hospital tent used as a carpenter’s shop had been burned down causing considerable
excitement. At one time it threatened to communicate the flames to the house, our
quarters as the tent was very near the latter. Ellison had his chest of carpenters tools
and Biederbeck lost most of his underclothing which he had washed and left drying in
the tent. Brainard and Linn returned at 8 p.m. They deposited the provisions on the
north side of St. Patrick’s Bay.

## Friday, September 23, 1881

This morning Lt. Kislingbury and I visit the musk ox offal to see if the poison
we had laid for them had brought about any results. We found two victims stretched


stark and stiff. They were both females with beautiful white coats. We carried them
both to camp a difficult task as the distance was fully a mile. They weighed 57 and
61 pounds respectively. They appeared much larger than their weight indicates as
they are very gaunt and thin. Their coats were beautiful, long white fur with a few
black hairs along the back. They measured five feet from tip of tail to nose. I
photographed one of them.


## Saturday, September 24, 1881

Lt. Lockwood started with four men to convey the rations left by Brainard in
St. Patrick’s Bay to Cape Beechey. I sent my photographic kit with instructions for
him to leave it at Watercourse Bay.


## Sunday, September 25, 1881

After breakfast, Cross and I start for Watercourse Bay. We travel by the
icefoot, finding the camera, etc. near the picturesque bergs referred to above. I
exposed six plates on the best subjects and left the apparatus to be brought in by the
returning party with the sledge. We come back overland getting into camp at 2 p.m.

## Monday 26, 1881

I started this morning accompanied by Jens the Esquimaux with sledge and
team of dogs ten to convey additional stores to depot “B” Cape Beechy. My load
consisted of pemmican and extract of beef. I had much difficulty until passed Cape
Murchison. I was compelled to unload the sled several times and carry it over rought
places. Several of the dogs fell into the water. It is difficult to understand how a sled
can be pulled through or over the rough ice front we traveled. Nothing but a
Greenland sledge, lashed together with walrus hide could stand the terrible strain
twisting we gave it; and no native power on earth other than a team of Eskimo dogs
could have dragged it. I found excellent traveling from Cape Murchison to Beechy
where I arrived at 3 p.m. After a jaunt of nine hours. I found Lt. Lockwood and
party in camp occupying the tent that had been erected by Brainard and his party
when the whaleboat was abandoned. As the tent was completely filled by the party,
Jens and I were compelled to sleep outside the tent with no shelter. Of course we
were in sleeping bags but the cold from the ground made our rest very uncomfortable.
We gave the dogs a meal of pemmican before turning in. They kept up a continual
wrangle all night — proving that they were not much fatigued. I therefore determined
to make an early start to return during the night - -10 rather cold for sleeping out.



## Tuesday, September 27, 1881

I started to return at 5:30 a.m. It was then threatening snow. Did not attempt
to cook any breakfast as the party in the tent had not arisen. I therefore kept on until
Cape Murchison was reached when I stopped about an hour making chocolate and
warming feet. Found icefoot changed by tide around Distant Cape and was
compelled to make new road. Arrived at home 1:30 p.m. Learned that the day before
a large male wolf had been shot near our quarters. Although gaunt and thin it
weighed 81lbs and was five foot from nose to tail. Lt. Kislingbury shot him. Wolf
stood 33 1/2 inches hind quarters and 33 inches fore. Today Connell and a companion
brought in another that had been poisoned. Lt. Lockwood returned at 8 p.m. He and
party were well run down. It snowed slightly today.


## Wednesday, September 28, 1881

A party of three went to Watercourse Bay and looked into the condition of the
muskox meat left there It was all right. They brought each a small piece home with
them.

## Thursday, September 29, 1881

The weather very fine today. First serenade of the season and intended for
sleepy Israel and myself. All the musical, or rather noise making instruments brought
into requisition. Dr. Pavy and Whistler preparing for the northern journey.


## Friday, September 30, 1881

Will the music never cease? The xylophone has experienced but little rest
since it has been unpacked. Dr. Pavy prevented from starting by threatening storm. I
however photographed the outfit, banners and bunting flying from both sledges.
Connell after breakfast, and Lt. K after dinner started out after wolves. Both returned
without success. The two natives astonished with an electric shock from the
Chronograph. The “Regulars” happy, as the dead horse, in other words, the advance
pay, worked off. Carpenters and tinsmith at work on the bathtub.

I developed the plates but find the dull weather and attempts to catch the ever
moving dogs makes the negatives wanting in detail.



## Saturday, October 1, 1881

The weather looked threatening. Dr. Pavy and Whistler postpone trip.

Today Dr. Pavy, Whistler and Eskimo Jens started Cape Joseph Henry. Their
object is to take provisions to be used when an attempt is made in the spring to reach
our most northerly point.

## Wednesday October 5, 1881

At 8:45a.m. Brainard, Bender and I started for the Bellows near the head of
Discovery Harbor. We took with us the new Hudson Bay sledge just completed by
Cross. We loaded it with tent, cooking utensils and provisions. I also took along
camera and plates with the intention of getting if possible a view of "The Bellows".
The weight of our load was 143 lbs. We reached "The Bellows", distant from camp
16 miles, at 3:40 p.m. A strong breeze was blowing and the temperature very cold.
Before we could get tent pitched Brainard had his nose and one cheek frozen. Bender
and I escaped from being frostbitten by rubbing the face almost continually. I set the
minimum thermometer I brought along and at 7 p.m. it read -15.
After preparing some chocolate over a spirit lamp we crawled into a sleeping bag.
Spent a miserable night. Expected to find some rubber blankets supposed to be left at
the Bellows by the party that had been there in September, but found they had been
taken away, so nothing between the snowy ground and the sleeping bag. It was
therefore extemely cold for that portion of our bodies nearest the ground.
